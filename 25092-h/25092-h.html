                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A few words are perhaps needed as an introduction to a work of far more
                    ambitious character, than any which I have before attempted. In venturing to
                    select a subject from the history of Rome, during its earlier ages, undeterred
                    by the failure or, at the best, partial success of writers far more eminent than
                    I can ever hope to become, I have been actuated by reasons, which, in order to
                    relieve myself from the possible charge of presumption, I will state briefly.
                </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It has long been my opinion, then, that there lay a vast field, rich with a
                    harvest of material almost virgin, for the romancer's use, in the history of
                    classic ages. And this at a period when the annals of every century and nation
                    since the Christian era have been ransacked, and reproduced, in endless variety,
                    for the entertainment of the hourly increasing reading world, is no small
                    advantage. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Again, I have fancied that I could discover a cause for the imperfect success of
                    great writers when dealing with classic <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page4">[pg 4]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fiction, in the
                    fact of their endeavoring to be too learned, of their aiming too much at
                    portraying Greeks and Romans, and too little at depicting men, forgetful that
                    under all changes of custom, and costume, in all countries, ages, and
                    conditions, the human heart is still the human heart, convulsed by the same
                    passions, chilled by the same griefs, burning with the same joys, and, in the
                    main, actuated by the same hopes and fears. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> With these views, I many years ago deliberately selected this subject, for a
                    novel, which has advanced by slow steps to such a degree of completeness as it
                    has now attained. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Having determined on trying my success in classical fiction, the conspiracy of
                    Cataline appeared to me, a theme particularly well adapted for the purpose, as
                    being an actual event of vast importance, and in many respects unparalleled in
                    history; as being partially familiar to every one, thoroughly understood perhaps
                    by no one, so slender are the authentic documents concerning it which have come
                    down to us, and so dark and mysterious the motives of the actors. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It possessed, therefore, among other qualifications, as the ground-work of a
                    historical Romance, one almost indispensable—that of indistinctness, which
                    gives scope to the exercise of imagination, without the necessity of falsifying
                    either the truths or the probabilities of history. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Of the execution, I have, of course, nothing to say; but <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5">[pg 5]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that I have sedulously avoided being overlearned; that few Latin words will be
                    found in the work—none whatsoever in the conversational parts, and none but the
                    names of articles which have no direct English appellation; and that it is
                    sufficiently simple and direct for the most unclassical reader. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> I hope that the costume, the manners of the people, and the antiquarian details
                    will be found sufficiently correct; if they be not, it is not for want of pains
                    or care; for I have diligently consulted all the authorities to which I could
                    command access. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> To the history of the strange events related in this tale, I have adhered most
                    scrupulously; and I believe that the dates, facts, and characters of the
                    individuals introduced, will not be found in any material respect, erroneous or
                    untrue; and here I may perhaps venture to observe, that, on reading the most
                    recently published lectures of Niebuhr, which never fell in my way until very
                    lately, I had the great satisfaction of finding the view I have always taken of
                    the character and motives of Cataline and his confederates, confirmed by the
                    opinion of that profound and sagacious critic and historian. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> I will only add, that it is hardly probable that "the Roman Traitor" would ever
                    have been finished had it not been for the strenuous advice of a friend, in
                    whose opinion I have the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page6">[pg 6]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>utmost confidence, Mr.
                    Benjamin, to whom some of the early chapters were casually shown, two or three
                    years ago, and who almost insisted on my completing it. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It is most fitting, therefore, that it should be, as it is, introduced to the
                    world under his auspices; since but for his favourable judgment, and for a
                    feeling on my own part that to fail in such an attempt would be scarce a
                    failure, while success would be success indeed, it would probably have never
                    seen the light of day! </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> With these few remarks, I submit the Roman Traitor to the candid judgment of my
                    friends and the public, somewhat emboldened by the uniform kindness and
                    encouragement which I have hitherto met; and with some hope that I may be
                    allowed at some future day, to lay another romance of the most famous, before
                    the citizens of the youngest republic. </p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Midnight was over Rome. The skies were dark and lowering, and ominous of
                    tempest; for it was a sirocco, and the welkin was overcast with sheets of vapory
                    cloud, not very dense, indeed, or solid, but still sufficient to intercept the
                    feeble twinkling of the stars, which alone held dominion in the firmament; since
                    the young crescent of the moon had sunk long ago beneath the veiled horizon. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The air was thick and sultry, and so unspeakably oppressive, that for above
                    three hours the streets had been entirely deserted. In a few houses of the
                    higher class, lights might be seen dimly shining through the casements of the
                    small chambers, hard beside the doorway, appropriated to the use of the
                    Atriensis, or slave whose charge it was to guard the entrance of the court. But,
                    for the most part, not a single ray cheered the dull murky streets, except that
                    here and there, before the holy shrine, or vaster and more elaborate temple, of
                    some one of Rome's hun<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page10">[pg 10]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>dred gods, the votive lanthorns,
                    though shorn of half their beams by the dense fog-wreaths, burnt perennial. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The period was the latter time of the republic, a few years after the fell
                    democratic persecutions of the plebeian Marius had drowned the mighty city
                    oceans-deep in patrician gore; after the awful retribution of the avenger Sylla
                    had rioted in the destruction of that guilty faction. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He who was destined one day to support the laurelled diadem of universal empire
                    on his bald brows, stood even now among the noblest, the most ambitious, and the
                    most famous of the state; though not as yet had he unfurled the eagle wings of
                    conquest over the fierce barbarian hordes of Gaul and Germany, or launched his
                    galleys on the untried waters of the great Western sea. A dissipated,
                    spendthrift, and luxurious youth, devoted solely as it would seem to the
                    pleasures of the table, or to intrigues with the most fair and noble of Rome's
                    ladies, he had yet, amid those unworthy occupations, displayed such gleams of
                    overmastering talent, such wondrous energy, such deep sagacity, and above all
                    such uncurbed though ill-directed ambition, that the perpetual Dictator had
                    already, years before, exclaimed with prescient wisdom,—"In yon unzoned youth I
                    perceive the germ of many a Marius." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> At the same time, the magnificent and princely leader, who was to be thereafter
                    his great rival, was reaping that rich crop of glory, the seeds of which had
                    been sown already by the wronged Lucullus, in the broad kingdoms of the
                    effeminate East. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Meanwhile, as Rome had gradually rendered herself, by the exertion of
                    indomitable valor, the supreme mistress of every foreign power that bordered on
                    the Mediterranean, wealth, avarice, and luxury, like some contagious pestilence,
                    had crept into the inmost vitals of the commonwealth, until the very features,
                    which had once made her famous, no less for her virtues than her valor, were
                    utterly obliterated and for ever. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Instead of a paternal, poor, brave, patriotic aristocracy, she had now a
                    nobility, valiant indeed and capable, but dissolute beyond the reach of man's
                    imagination, boundless in their expenditures, reckless as to the mode of gaining
                    wherewithal to support them, oppressive and despotical to their inferiors,
                    smooth-tongued and hypocritical toward <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page11">[pg 11]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>each other,
                    destitute equally of justice and compassion toward men, and of respect and piety
                    toward the Gods! Wealth had become the idol, the god of the whole people!
                    Wealth—and no longer service, eloquence, daring, or integrity,—was held the
                    requisite for office. Wealth now conferred upon its owner, all magistracies all
                    guerdons—rank, power, command,—consulships, provinces, and armies. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The senate—once the most grave and stern and just assembly that the world had
                    seen—was now, with but a few superb exceptions, a timid, faithless, and
                    licentious oligarchy; while—name whilome so majestical and mighty!—the people,
                    the great Roman people, was but a mob! a vile colluvion of the offscourings of
                    all climes and regions—Greeks, Syrians, Africans, Barbarians from the chilly
                    north, and eunuchs from the vanquished Orient, enfranchised slaves, and
                    liberated gladiators—a factious, turbulent, fierce rabble! </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Such was the state of Rome, when it would seem that the Gods, wearied with the
                    guilt of her aggrandisement, sick of the slaughter by which she had won her way
                    to empire almost universal, had judged her to destruction—had given her up to
                    perish, not by the hands of any foreign foe, but by her own; not by the wisdom,
                    conduct, bravery of others, but by her own insanity and crime. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But at this darkest season of the state one hope was left to Rome—one
                    safeguard. The united worth of Cicero and Cato! The statesmanship, the
                    eloquence, the splendid and unequalled parts of the former; the stern
                    self-denying virtue, the unchanged constancy, the resolute and hard integrity of
                    the latter; these, singular and severally, might have availed to prop a falling
                    dynasty—united, might have preserved a world! </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The night was such as has already been described: gloomy and lowering in its
                    character, as was the aspect of the political horizon, and most congenial to the
                    fearful plots, which were even now in progress against the lives of Rome's best
                    citizens, against the sanctity of her most solemn temples, the safety of her
                    domestic hearths, the majesty of her inviolable laws, the very existence of her
                    institutions, of her empire, of herself as one among the nations of the earth. </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page12">[pg 12]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Most suitable, indeed, was that dim murky night, most favorable the solitude of
                    the deserted streets, to the measures of those parricides of the Republic, who
                    lurked within her bosom, thirsty for blood, and panting to destroy. Nor had they
                    overlooked the opportunity. But a few days remained before that on which the
                    Consular elections, fixed for the eighteenth of October, were to take place in
                    the Campus Martius—whereat, it was already understood that Sergius Cataline,
                    frustrated the preceding year, by the election of the great orator of Arpinum to
                    his discomfiture, was about once more to try the fortunes of himself and of the
                    popular faction. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was at this untimely hour, that a man might have been seen lurking beneath
                    the shadows of an antique archway, decorated with half-obliterated sculptures of
                    the old Etruscan school, in one of the narrow and winding streets which, lying
                    parallel to the Suburra, ran up the hollow between the Viminal and Quirinal
                    hills. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He was a tall and well-framed figure, though so lean as to seem almost
                    emaciated. His forehead was unusually high and narrow, and channelled with deep
                    horizontal lines of thought and passion, across which cut at right angles the
                    sharp furrows of a continual scowl, drawing the corners of his heavy coal-black
                    eyebrows into strange contiguity. Beneath these, situated far back in their
                    cavernous recesses, a pair of keen restless eyes glared out with an expression
                    fearful to behold—a jealous, and unquiet, ever-wandering glance—so sinister,
                    and ominous, and above all so indicative of a perturbed and anguished spirit,
                    that it could not be looked upon without suggesting those wild tales, which
                    speak of fiends dwelling in the revivified and untombed carcasses of those who
                    die in unrepented sin. His nose was keenly Roman; with a deep wrinkle seared, as
                    it would seem, into the sallow flesh from either nostril downward. His mouth,
                    grimly compressed, and his jaws, for the most part, firmly clinched together,
                    spoke volumes of immutable and iron resolution; while all his under lip was
                    scarred, in many places, with the trace of wounds, inflicted beyond doubt, in
                    some dread paroxysm, by the very teeth it covered. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The dress which this remarkable looking individual at that time wore, was the
                        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">penula</span></span>, as it was called; a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page13">[pg 13]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>short, loose straight-cut overcoat, reaching a little way below the knees, not
                    fitted to the shape, but looped by woollen frogs all down the front, with broad
                    flaps to protect the arms, and a square cape or collar, which at the pleasure of
                    the wearer could be drawn up so as to conceal all the lower part of the
                    countenance, or suffered to fall down upon the shoulders. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> This uncouth vestment, which was used only by men of the lowest order, or by
                    others solely when engaged in long and toilsome journeys, or in cold wintry
                    weather, was composed of a thick loose-napped frieze or serge, of a dark
                    purplish brown, with loops and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fibulæ</span></span>, or frogs, of a
                    dull dingy red. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The wearer's legs were bare down to the very feet, which were protected by
                    coarse shoes of heavy leather, fastened about the ancles by a thong, with a
                    clasp of marvellously ill-cleaned brass. Upon his head he had a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">petasus</span></span>, or broad-brimmed hat of gray felt, fitting close
                    to the skull, with a long fall behind, not very unlike in form to the
                    south-wester of a modern seaman. This article of dress was, like the penula,
                    although peculiar to the inferior classes, oftentimes worn by men of superior
                    rank, when journeying abroad. From these, therefore, little or no aid was given
                    to conjecture, as to the station of the person, who now shrunk back into the
                    deepest gloom of the old archway, now peered out stealthily into the night,
                    grinding his teeth and muttering smothered imprecations against some one, who
                    had failed to meet him. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The shoes, however, of rude, ill-tanned leather, of a form and manufacture which
                    was peculiar to the lowest artizans or even slaves, were such as no man of
                    ordinary standing would under any circumstances have adopted. Yet if these would
                    have implied that the wearer was of low plebeian origin, this surmise was
                    contradicted by several rings decked with gems of great price and splendor—one
                    a large deeply-engraved signet—which were distinctly visible by their lustre on
                    the fingers of both his hands. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> His air and carriage too were evidently in accordance with the nobility of birth
                    implied by these magnificent adornments, rather than with the humble station
                    betokened by the rest of his attire. </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page14">[pg 14]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> His motions were quick, irritable, and incessant! His pace, as he stalked to and
                    fro in the narrow area of the archway, was agitated, and uneven. Now he would
                    stride off ten or twelve steps with strange velocity, then pause, and stand
                    quite motionless for perhaps a minute's space, and then again resume his walk
                    with slow and faltering gestures, to burst forth once again, as at the
                    instigation of some goading spirit, to the same short-lived energy and speed. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Meantime, his color went and came; he bit his lip, till the blood trickled down
                    his clean shorn chin; he clinched his hands, and smote them heavily together,
                    and uttered in a harsh hissing whisper the most appalling imprecations—on his
                    own head—on him who had deceived him—on Rome, and all her myriads of
                    inhabitants—on earth, and sea, and heaven—on everything divine or human! </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "The black plague 'light on the fat sleepy glutton!—nay, rather all the fiends
                    and furies of deep Erebus pursue <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">me</span></span>!—me!—me, who was
                    fool enough to fancy that aught of bold design or manly daring could rouse up
                    the dull, adipose, luxurious loiterer from his wines—his concubines—his
                    slumbers!—And now—the dire ones hunt him to perdition! Now, the seventh hour
                    of night hath passed, and all await us at the house of Læca; and this foul
                    sluggard sottishly snores at home!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> While he was cursing yet, and smiting his broad chest, and gnashing his teeth in
                    impotent malignity, suddenly a quick step became audible at a distance. The
                    sound fell on his ear sharpened by the stimulus of fiery passions and of
                    conscious fear, long ere it could have been perceived by any ordinary listener. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "'Tis he," he said, "'tis he at last—but no?" he continued, after a pause of a
                    second, during which he had stooped, and laid his ear close to the ground, "no!
                    'tis too quick and light for the gross Cassius. By all the gods! there are two!
                    Can he, then, have betrayed me? No! no! By heavens! he dare not!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> At the same time he started back into the darkest corner of the arch, pulled up
                    the cape of his cassock, and slouched the wide-brimmed hat over his anxious
                    lineaments; then pressing his body flat against the dusky wall, to which the
                    color of his garments was in some sort <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page15">[pg 15]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>assimilated, he
                    awaited the arrival of the new-comers, perhaps hoping that if foreign to his
                    purpose they might pass by him in the gloom. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> As the footsteps now sounded nearer, he thrust his right hand into the bosom of
                    his cassock, and drew out a long broad two-edged dagger, or stiletto; and as he
                    unsheathed it, "Ready!" he muttered to himself, "ready for either fortune!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Nearer and nearer came the footsteps, and the blent sounds of the two were now
                    distinctly audible—one a slow, listless tread, as of one loitering along, as if
                    irresolute whether to turn back or proceed; the other a firm, rapid, and decided
                    step. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ha! it is well!" resumed the listener; "Cassius it is; and with him comes
                    Cethegus, though where they have joined company I marvel." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And, as he spoke, he put his weapon back into his girdle, where it was perfectly
                    concealed by the folds of the penula. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ho!—stand!" he whispered, as the two men whose steps he had heard, entered the
                    archway, "Stand, Friends and Brethren." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Hail, Sergius!" replied the foremost; a tall and splendidly formed man, with a
                    dark quick eye, and regular features, nobly chiselled and in all respects
                    such—had it not been for the bitter and ferocious sneer, which curled his
                    haughty lip, at every word—as might be termed eminently handsome. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He wore his raven hair in long and flowing curls, which hung quite down upon his
                    shoulders—a fashion that was held in Rome to the last degree effeminate, indeed
                    almost infamous—while his trim whiskers and close curly beard reeked with the
                    richest perfumes, impregnating the atmosphere through which he passed with odors
                    so strong as to be almost overpowering. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> His garb was that of a patrician of the highest order; though tinctured, like
                    the arrangement of his hair, with not a little of that soft luxurious taste
                    which had, of latter years, begun so generally to pervade Rome's young nobility.
                    His under dress or tunic, was not of that succinct and narrow cut, which had so
                    well become the sturdy fathers of the new republic! but—beside being wrought
                        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page16">[pg 16]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of the finest Spanish wool of snowy whiteness,
                    with the broad crimson facings indicative of his senatorial rank, known as the
                    laticlave—fell in loose folds half way between his knee and ancle. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It had sleeves, too, a thing esteemed unworthy of a man—and was fringed at the
                    cuffs, and round the hem, with a deep passmenting of crimson to match the
                    laticlave. His toga of the thinnest and most gauzy texture, and whiter even than
                    his tunic, flowed in a series of classical and studied draperies quite to his
                    heels, where like the tunic it was bordered by a broad crimson trimming. His
                    feet were ornamented, rather than protected, by delicate buskins of black
                    leather, decked with the silver <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sigma</span></span>, in its old
                    crescent shape, the proud initial of the high term senator. A golden bracelet,
                    fashioned like a large serpent, exquisitely carved with horrent scales and
                    forked tail, was twined about the wrist of his right arm, with a huge carbuncle
                    set in the head, and two rare diamonds for eyes. A dozen rings gemmed with the
                    clearest brilliants sparkled upon his white and tapering fingers; in which, to
                    complete the picture, he bore a handkerchief of fine Egyptian cambric, or Byssus
                    as the Romans styled it, embroidered at the edges in arabesques of golden
                    thread. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> His comrade was if possible more slovenly in his attire than his friend was
                    luxurious and expensive. He wore no toga, and his tunic—which, without the
                    upper robe, was the accustomed dress of gladiators, slaves, and such as were too
                    poor to wear the full and characteristic attire of the Roman citizen—was of
                    dark brownish woollen, threadbare, and soiled with spots of grease, and patched
                    in many places. His shoes were of coarse clouted leather, and his legs were
                    covered up to the knees by thongs of ill-tanned cowhide rolled round them and
                    tied at the ancles with straps of the same material. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "A plague on both of you!" replied the person, who had been so long awaiting
                    them, in answer to their salutation. "Two hours have ye detained me here; and
                    now that ye have come, in pretty guise ye do come! Oh! by the gods! a well
                    assorted pair. Cassius more filthy than the vilest and most base tatterdemalion
                    of the stews, and with him rare Cethegus, a senator in all his bravery! Wise
                    judgment! excellent disguises! I know not whe<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page17">[pg 17]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ther most
                    to marvel at the insane and furious temerity of this one, or at the idiotic
                    foolery of that! Well fitted are ye both for a great purpose. And now—may the
                    dark furies hunt you to perdition!—what hath delayed you?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Why, what a coil is here", replied the gay Cethegus, delighted evidently at the
                    unsuppressed anger of his confederate in crime, and bent on goading to yet more
                    fiery wrath his most ungovernable temper. "Methinks, O pleasant Sergius, the
                    moisture of this delectable night should have quenched somewhat the quick flames
                    of your most amiable and placid humor! Keep thy hard words, I prithee, Cataline,
                    for those who either heed or dread them. I, thou well knowest, do neither." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Peace, peace! Cethegus; plague him no farther," interrupted Cassius, just as
                    the fierce conspirator, exclaiming in a deep harsh whisper, the one word "Boy!"
                    strode forth as if to strike him. "And thou, good Cataline, listen to reason—we
                    have been dogged hitherward, and so came by circuitous byeways!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Dogged, said ye—dogged? and by whom?—doth the slave live, who dared it?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "By a slave, as we reckon," answered Cassius, "for he wore no toga; and his
                    tunic"— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Was filthy—very filthy, by the gods!—most like thine own, good Cassius,"
                    interposed Cethegus. <span class="tei tei-corr">"But,</span> in good sooth, he <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">was</span></span> a slave,
                    my Sergius. He passed us twice, before I thought much of it. Once as we crossed
                    the sacred way after descending from the Palatine—and once again beside the
                    shrine of Venus in the Cyprian street. The second time he gazed into my very
                    eyes, until he caught my glance meeting his own, and then with a quick bounding
                    pace he hurried onward." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Tush!" answered Cataline, "tush! was that all? the knave was a chance
                    night-walker, and frightened ye! Ha! ha! by Hercules! it makes me
                    laugh—frightened the rash and overbold Cethegus!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "It was not all!" replied Cethegus very calmly, "it was not all, Cataline. And,
                    but that we are joined here in a purpose so mighty that it overwhelms all
                    private interests, all mere considerations of the individual, you, my good sir,
                    should learn what it is to taunt a man with fear, who fears not anything—least
                    of all thee! But it was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page18">[pg 18]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>not all. For as we turned from
                    a side lane into the Wicked<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> street that scales the summit of the Esquiline,
                    my eye caught something lurking in the dark shadow cast over an angle of the
                    wall by a large cypress. I seized the arm of Cassius, to check his speech"— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ha! did the fat idiot speak?—what said he?" interrupted Cataline. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Nothing," replied the other, "nothing, at least, of any moment. Well, I caught
                    Cassius by the arm, and was in the act of pointing, when from the shadows of the
                    tree out sprang this self-same varlet, whereon I——". </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Rushed on him! dragged him into the light! and smote him, thus, and thus, and
                    thus! didst thou not, excellent Cethegus?" Cataline exclaimed fiercely in a hard
                    stern whisper, making three lounges, while he spoke, as if with a stiletto. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I did not any of these things," answered the other. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And why not, I say, why not? why not?" cried Cataline with rude impetuosity. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "That shall I answer, when you give me time," said Cethegus, coolly. "Because
                    when I rushed forth, he fled with an exceeding rapid flight; leaped the low wall
                    into the graveyard of the base Plebeians, and there among the cypresses and
                    overthrown sepulchres escaped me for a while. I beat about most warily, and at
                    length started him up again from the jaws of an obscene and broken catacomb. I
                    gained on him at every step; heard the quick panting of his breath; stretched
                    out my left to grasp him, while my right held unsheathed and ready the good
                    stiletto that ne'er failed me. And now—now—by the great Jove! his tunic's hem
                    was fluttering in my clutch, when my feet tripped over a prostrate column, that
                    I was hurled five paces at the least in advance of the fugitive; and when I rose
                    again, sore stunned, and bruised, and breathless, the slave had vanished." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And where, I prithee, during this well-concerted chase, was valiant Cassius?"
                    enquired Cataline, with a hoarse sneering laugh. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "During the chase, I knew not," answered Cethegus, "but when it was over, and I
                    did return, I found him <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page19">[pg 19]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>leaning on the wall, even in
                    the angle whence the slave fled on our approach." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Asleep! I warrant me—by the great gods! asleep!" exclaimed the other; "but
                    come!—come, let us onward,—I trow we have been waited for—and as we go, tell
                    me, I do beseech thee, what was't that Cassius said, when the slave lay beside
                    ye?—" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Nay, but I have forgotten—some trivial thing or other—oh! now I do bethink
                    me, he said it was a long walk to Marcus Læca's." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Fool! fool! Double and treble fool! and dost thou call this nothing? Nothing to
                    tell the loitering informer the very head and heart of our design? By Erebus!
                    but I am sick—sick of the fools, with whom I am thus wretchedly assorted! Well!
                    well! upon your own heads be it!" and instantly recovering his temper he walked
                    on with his two confederates, now in deep silence, at a quick pace through the
                    deserted streets towards their perilous rendezvous. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Noiseless, with stealthy steps, they hurried onward, threading the narrow pass
                    between the dusky hills, until they reached a dark and filthy lane which turning
                    at right angles led to the broad thoroughfare of the more showy, though by no
                    means less ill-famed Suburra. Into this they struck instantly, walking in single
                    file, and keeping as nearly as possible in the middle of the causeway. The lane,
                    which was composed of dwellings of the lowest order, tenanted by the most abject
                    profligates, was dark as midnight; for the tall dingy buildings absolutely
                    intercepted every ray of light that proceeded from the murky sky, and there was
                    not a spark in any of the sordid casements, nor any votive lamp in that foul
                    alley. The only glimpse of casual illumination, and that too barely serving to
                    render the darkness and the filth perceptible, was the faint streak of lustre
                    where the Suburra crossed the far extremity of the bye-path. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Scarce had they made three paces down the alley, ere the quick eye of Cataline,
                    for ever roving in search of aught suspicious, caught the dim outline of a human
                    figure, stealing across this pallid gleam. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Hist! hist!" he whiskered in stern low tones, which though inaudible at three
                    yards' distance completely filled the ears of him to whom they were
                    addressed—"hist! <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page20">[pg 20]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>hist! Cethegus; seest thou
                    not—seest thou not there? If it be he, he 'scapes us not again!—out with thy
                    weapon, man, and strike at once, if that thou have a chance; but if not, do
                    thou go on with Cassius to the appointed place. Leave him to me! and say, I
                    follow ye! See! he hath slunk into the darkness. Separate ye, and occupy the
                    whole width of the street, while I dislodge him!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And as he spoke, unsheathing his broad poignard, but holding it concealed
                    beneath his cassock, he strode on boldly, affecting the most perfect
                    indifference, and even insolence of bearing. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Meanwhile the half-seen figure had entirely disappeared amid the gloom; yet had
                    the wary eye of the conspirator, in the one momentary glance he had obtained,
                    been able to detect with something very near to certainty the spot wherein the
                    spy, if such he were, lay hidden. As he approached the place—whereat a heap of
                    rubbish, the relics of a building not long ago as it would seem consumed by
                    fire, projected far into the street—seeing no sign whatever of the man who, he
                    was well assured, was not far distant, he paused a little so as to suffer his
                    companions to draw near. Then as they came up with him, skilled in all deep and
                    desperate wiles, he instantly commenced a whispered conversation, a tissue of
                    mere nonsense, with here and there a word of seeming import clearly and audibly
                    pronounced. Nor was his dark manœuvre unsuccessful; for as he uttered the word
                    "Cicero," watching meanwhile the heap of ruins as jealously as ever tiger glared
                    on its destined prey, he caught a tremulous outline; and in a second's space, a
                    small round object, like a man's head, was protruded from the darkness, and
                    brought into relief against the brighter back ground. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Then—then—with all the fury—all the lythe agile vigor, all the unrivalled
                    speed, and concentrated fierceness of that tremendous beast of prey, he dashed
                    upon his victim! But at the first slight movement of his sinewy form, the dimly
                    seen shape vanished; impetuously he rushed on among the piles of scattered brick
                    and rubbish, and, ere he saw the nature of the place, plunged down a deep
                    descent into the cellar of the ruin. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Lucky was it for Cataline, and most unfortunate for Rome, that when the building
                    fell, its fragments had choked three parts of the depth of that subterranean
                    vault; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page21">[pg 21]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>so that it was but from a height of three or
                    four feet at the utmost, that the fierce desperado was precipitated! </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Still, to a man less active, the accident might have been serious, but with
                    instinctive promptitude, backed by a wonderful exertion of muscular agility, he
                    writhed his body even in the act of falling so that he lighted on his feet; and,
                    ere a second had elapsed after his fall, was extricating himself from the broken
                    masses of cement and brickwork, and soon stood unharmed, though somewhat stunned
                    and shaken, on the very spot which had been occupied scarcely a minute past by
                    the suspected spy. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> At the same point of time in which the conspirator fell, the person, whosoever
                    he was, in pursuit of whom he had plunged so heedlessly into the ruins, darted
                    forth from his concealment close to the body and within arm's length of the
                    fierce Cethegus, whose attention was for the moment distracted from his watch by
                    the catastrophe which had befallen his companion. Dodging by a quick
                    movement—so quick that it seemed almost the result of instinct—so to elude the
                    swift attempt of his enemy to arrest his progress, the spy was forced to rush
                    almost into the arms of Cassius. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Yet this appeared not to cause him any apprehension; for he dashed boldly on,
                    till they were almost front to front; when, notwithstanding his unwieldy frame
                    and inactivity of habit, spurred into something near to energy by the very
                    imminence of peril, the worn-out debauchee bestirred himself as if to seize him. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> If such, however, were his intention, widely had he miscalculated his own
                    powers, and fatally underrated the agility and strength of the stranger—a tall,
                    thin, wiry man, well nigh six feet in height, broad shouldered, and deep
                    chested, and thin flanked, and limbed like a Greek Athlete. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> On he dashed!—on—right on! till they stood face to face; and then with one
                    quick blow, into which, as it seemed, he put but little of his strength, he
                    hurled the burly Cassius to the earth, and fled with swift and noiseless steps
                    into the deepest gloom. Perceiving on the instant the necessity of apprehending
                    this now undoubted spy, the fiery Cethegus paused not one instant to look after
                    his discomfited companions; but rushed away on the traces of the fugitive, who
                    had perhaps gained, at the very <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page22">[pg 22]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>utmost, a dozen paces'
                    start of him, in that wild midnight race—that race for life and death. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The slave, for such from his dark tunic he appeared to me, was evidently both a
                    swift and practised runner; and well aware how great a stake was on his speed he
                    now strained every muscle to escape, while scarce less fleet, and straining
                    likewise every sinew to the utmost, Cethegus panted at his very heels. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Before, however, they had run sixty yards, one swifter than Cethegus took up the
                    race; and bruised although he was, and stunned, and almost breathless when he
                    started, ere he had overtaken his staunch friend, which he did in a space
                    wonderfully brief, he seemed to have shaken off every ailment, and to be in the
                    completest and most firm possession of all his wonted energies. As he caught up
                    Cethegus, he relaxed somewhat of his speed, and ran on by his side for some few
                    yards at a sort of springy trot, speaking the while in a deep whisper, </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Hist!" he said, "hist!—I am more swift of foot than thou, and deeper winded.
                    Leave me to deal with this dog! Back thou, to him thou knowest of; sore is he
                    hurt, I warrant me. Comfort him as thou best mayest, and hurry whither we were
                    now going. 'Tis late even now—too late, I fear me much, and doubtless we are
                    waited for. I have the heels of this same gallowsbird, that can I see already!
                    Leave me to deal with him, and <span class="tei tei-sic">an</span> he tells tales on us,
                    then call me liar!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Already well nigh out of breath himself, while the endurance of the fugitive
                    seemed in nowise affected, and aware of the vast superiority of his brother
                    conspirator's powers to his own, Cethegus readily enough yielded to his positive
                    and reiterated orders, and turning hastily backward, gathered up the bruised and
                    groaning Cassius, and led him with all speed toward the well-known rendezvous in
                    the house of Læca. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Meanwhile with desperate speed that headlong race continued; the gloomy alley
                    was passed through; the wider street into which it debouched, vanished beneath
                    their quick beating footsteps; the dark and shadowy arch, wherein the chief
                    conspirator had lurked, was threaded at full speed; and still, although he
                    toiled, till the sweat dripped from every pore like gouts of summer rain, al<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page23">[pg 23]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>though he plied each limb, till every over-wrought
                    sinew seemed to crack, the hapless fugitive could gain no ground on his
                    inveterate pursuer; who, cool, collected and unwearied, without one drop of
                    perspiration on his dark sallow brow, without one panting sob in his deep
                    breath, followed on at an equable and steady pace, gaining not any thing, nor
                    seeming to desire to gain any thing, while yet within the precincts of the
                    populous and thickly-settled city. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But now they crossed the broad Virbian street. The slave, distinctly visible for
                    such, as he glanced by a brightly decorated shrine girt by so many brilliant
                    lamps as shewed its tenant idol to have no lack of worshippers, darted up a
                    small street leading directly towards the Esquiline. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Now! now!" lisped Cataline between his hard-set teeth, "now he is mine, past
                    rescue!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Up the dark filthy avenue they sped, the fierce pursuer now gaining on the
                    fugitive at every bound; till, had he stretched his arm out, he might have
                    seized him; till his breath, hot and strong, waved the disordered elf-locks that
                    fell down upon the bare neck of his flying victim. And now the low wall of the
                    Plebeian burying ground arose before them, shaded by mighty cypresses and
                    overgrown with tangled ivy. At one wild bound the hunted slave leaped over it,
                    into the trackless gloom. At one wild bound the fierce pursuer followed him.
                    Scarcely a yard asunder they alighted on the rank grass of that charnel grove;
                    and not three paces did they take more, ere Cataline had hurled his victim to
                    the earth, and cast himself upon him; choking his cries for help by the
                    compression of his sinewy fingers, which grasped with a tenacity little inferior
                    to that of an iron vice the miserable wretch's gullet. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He snatched his poniard from his sheath, reared it on high with a well skilled
                    and steady hand! Down it came, noiseless and unseen. For there was not a ray of
                    light to flash along its polished blade. Down it came with almost the speed and
                    force of the electric fluid. A deep, dull, heavy sound was heard, as it was
                    plunged into the yielding flesh, and the hot gushing blood spirted forth in a
                    quick jet into the very face and mouth of the fell mur<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page24">[pg 24]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>derer. A terrible convulsion, a fierce writhing spasm followed—so strong, so
                    muscularly powerful, that the stern gripe of Cataline was shaken from the throat
                    of his victim, and from his dagger's hilt! </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In the last agony the murdered man cast off his slayer from his breast; started
                    erect upon his feet! tore out, from the deep wound, the fatal weapon which had
                    made it; hurled it far—far as his remaining strength permitted—into the
                    rayless night; burst forth into a wild and yelling cry, half laughter and half
                    imprecation; fell headlong to the earth—which was no more insensible than he,
                    what time he struck it, to any sense of mortal pain or sorrow—and perished
                    there alone, unpitied and unaided. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Habet</span></span>!—he hath it!" muttered
                    Cataline, quoting the well-known expression of the gladiatorial strife; "he hath
                    it!—but all the plagues of Erebus, light on it—my good stiletto lies near to
                    him in the swart darkness, to testify against me; nor by great Hecate! is there
                    one chance to ten of finding it. Well! be it so!" he added, turning upon his
                    heel, "be it so, for most like it hath fallen in the deep long grass, where none
                    will ever find it; and if they do, I care not!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And with a reckless and unmoved demeanor, well pleased with his success, and
                    casting not one retrospective thought toward his murdered victim, not one
                    repentant sigh upon his awful crime, he too hurried away to join his dread
                    associates at their appointed meeting. </p>

                    storm-clouds and the drizzling rain, some streaks of early dawn might have been
                    seen on the horizon, when at the door of Marcus Læca, in the low grovelling
                    street of the Scythemakers—strange quarter for the residence of a patrician,
                    one of the princely Porcii—the arch-conspirator stood still, and glared around
                    with keen suspicious eyes, after his hurried walk. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was, however, yet as black as midnight; nor in that wretched and base suburb,
                    tenanted only by poor laborious artizans, was there a single artificial light to
                    relieve the gloom of nature. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The house of Læca! How little would the passer-by who looked in those days on

                    have imagined that its fame would go down to the latest ages, imperishable
                    through its owner's infamy. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The house of Læca! The days had been, while Rome was yet but young, when it
                    stood far aloof in the gay green fields, the suburban villa of the proud Porcian
                    house. Time passed, and fashions changed. Low streets and squalid tenements
                    supplanted the rich fields and fruitful orchards, which had once rendered it so
                    pleasant an abode. Its haughty lords abandoned it for a more stately palace nigh
                    the forum, and for long years it had <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page26">[pg 26]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>remained
                    tenantless, voiceless, desolate. But dice, and wine, and women, mad luxury and
                    boundless riot, had brought its owner down to indigence, and infamy and sin. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The palace passed away from its inheritor. The ruin welcomed its last lord. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And here, meet scene for orgies such as it beheld, Rome's parricides were wont

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> With a slow stealthy tread, that woke no echo, Cataline advanced to the door.
                    There was no lamp in the cell of the atriensis; no sign of wakefulness in any of
                    the casements; yet at the first slight tap upon the stout oaken pannel, although
                    it was scarce louder than the plash of the big raindrops from the eaves, another
                    tap responded to it from within, so faint that it appeared an echo of the other.
                    The rebel counted, as fast as possible, fifteen; and then tapped thrice as he
                    had done before, meeting the same reply, a repetition of his own signal. After a
                    moment's interval, a little wicket opened in the door, and a low voice asked
                    "Who?" In the same guarded tone the answer was returned, "Cornelius." Again the
                    voice asked, "Which?" and instantly, as Cataline replied, "the third," the door
                    flew open, and he entered. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Atrium, or wide hall in which he stood, was all in utter darkness; there was
                    no light on the altar of the Penates, which was placed by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">impluvium</span></span>—a large shallow tank of water occupying the centre of the
                    hall in all Roman houses—nor any gleam from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tablinum</span></span>, or closed gallery beyond, parted by heavy curtains from the
                    audience chamber. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> There were no stars to glimmer through the opening in the roof above the central
                    tank, yet the quick eye of the conspirator perceived, upon the instant, that two
                    strong men with naked swords, their points within a hand's breadth of his bosom,
                    stood on each side <span class="tei tei-corr">of</span> the doorway. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The gate was closed as silently as it had given him entrance; was barred and
                    bolted; and till then no word was interchanged. When all, however, was secure, a
                    deep rich voice, suppressed into a whisper, exclaimed "Sergius?" "Ay!" answered
                    Cataline. "Come on!" and without farther parley they stole into the most secret
                        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page27">[pg 27]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>chambers of the house, fearful as it appeared of
                    the sounds of their own footsteps, much more of their own voices. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Thus with extreme precaution, when they had traversed several chambers, among
                    which were an indoor <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">triclinium</span></span>, or dining parlor, and a
                    vast picture gallery, groping their way along in utter darkness, they reached a
                    small square court, surrounded by a peristyle or colonnade, containing a
                    dilapidated fountain. Passing through this, they reached a second dining room,
                    where on the central table they found a small lamp burning, and by the aid of
                    this, though still observing the most scrupulous silence, quickly attained their
                    destination—a low and vaulted chamber entirely below the surface of the ground,
                    accessible only by a stair defended by two doors of unusual thickness. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> That was a fitting place for deeds of darkness, councils of desperation, such as
                    they held, who met within its gloomy precincts. The moisture, which dripped
                    constantly from its groined roof of stone, had formed stalactites of dingy spar,
                    whence the large gouts plashed heavily on the damp pavement; the walls were
                    covered with green slimy mould; the atmosphere was close and fœtid, and so heavy
                    that the huge waxen torches, four of which stood in rusty iron candelabra, on a
                    large slab of granite, burned dim and blue, casting a faint and ghastly light on
                    lineaments so grim and truculent, or so unnaturally excited by the dominion of
                    all hellish passions, that they had little need of anything extraneous to render
                    them most hideous and appalling. There were some twenty-five men present,
                    variously clad indeed, and of all ages, but evidently—though many had
                    endeavoured to disguise the fact by poor and sordid garments—all of the higher
                    ranks. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Six or eight were among them, who feared not, nor were ashamed to appear there
                    in the full splendor of their distinctive garb as Senators, prominent among whom
                    was the most rash and furious of them all, Cethegus. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He, at the moment when the arch-conspirator, accompanied by Læca and the rest of
                    those who had admitted him, entered the vault, was speaking with much energy and
                    even fierceness of manner to three or four who stood apart a little from the
                    rest with their backs to the door, listening with knitted brows, clenched hands,
                    and lips <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page28">[pg 28]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>compressed and bloodless, to his tremendous
                    imprecations launched at the heads of all who were for any, even the least,
                    delay in the accomplishment of their dread scheme of slaughter. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> One among them was a large stately looking personage, somewhat inclined to
                    corpulence, but showing many a sign of giant strength, and vigor unimpaired by
                    years or habit. His head was large but well shaped, with a broad and massive
                    forehead, and an eye keen as the eagle's when soaring in his pride of place. His
                    nose was prominent, but rather aquiline than Roman. His mouth, wide and
                    thick-lipped, with square and fleshy jaws, was the worst feature in his face,
                    and indicative of indulged sensuality and fierceness, if not of cruelty combined
                    with the excess of pride. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> This man wore the plain toga and white tunic of a private citizen; but never did
                    plebeian eye and lip flash with such concentrated haughtiness, curl with so fell
                    a sneer, as those of that fallen consular, of that degraded senator, the
                    haughtiest and most ambitious of a race never deficient in those qualities, he
                    who, drunk with despairing pride, and deceived to his ruin by the double-tongued
                    Sibylline prophecies, aspired to be that third Cornelius, who should be master
                    of the world's mistress, Rome. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The others were much younger men, for Lentulus was at that period already past
                    his prime, and these—two more especially who looked mere boys—had scarcely
                    reached youth's threshold; though their pale withered faces, and brows seared
                    deeply by the scorching brand of evil passions, showed that in vice at least, if
                    not in years, they had lived long already. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Those two were senators in their full garniture, the sons of Servius Sylla, both
                    beautiful almost as women, with soft and feminine features, and long curled
                    hair, and lips of coral, from which in flippant and affected accents fell words,
                    and breathed desires, that would have made the blood stop and turn stagnant at
                    the heart of any one, not utterly polluted and devoid of every humane feeling. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> This little knot seemed fierce for action, fiery and panting with that wolfish
                    thirst, to quench which blood must flow. But all the rest seemed dumb, and
                    tongue-tied, and crest-fallen. The sullenness of fear brooded on every other <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page29">[pg 29]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>face. The torpor of despairing crime, already in its
                    own fancy baffled and detected, had fallen on every other heart. For, at the
                    farther end of the room, whispering to his trembling hearers dubious and dark
                    suspicions, with terror on his tongue, stood Cassius, exaggerating the
                    adventures of the night. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Such was the scene, when Cataline stalked into that bad conclave. The fires of
                    hell itself could send forth no more blasting glare, than shot from his dark
                    eyes, as he beheld, and read at half a glance their consternation. Bitter and
                    blighting was the sneer upon his lip, as he stood motionless, gazing upon them
                    for a little space. Then flinging his arm on high and striding to the table he
                    dashed his hand upon it, that it rang and quivered to the blow. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "What are ye?" he said slowly, in tones that thrilled to every heart, so
                    piercing was their emphasis. "Men?—No, by the Gods! men rush on death for
                    glory!—Women? They risk it, for their own, their children's, or their lover's
                    safety!—Slaves?—Nay! even these things welcome it for freedom, or meet it with
                    revenge! Less then, than men! than women, slaves, or beasts!—Perish like
                    cattle, if ye will, unbound but unresisting, all armed but unavenged!—And
                    ye—great Gods! I laugh to see your terror-blanched, blank visages. I laugh, but
                    loathe in laughing! The destined dauntless sacrificers, who would imbue your
                    knives in senatorial, consular gore! kindle your altars on the downfallen
                    Capitol! and build your temples on the wreck of Empire! Ha! do you start? and
                    does some touch of shame redden the sallow cheeks that courage had left
                    bloodless? and do ye grasp your daggers, and rear your drooping heads? are ye
                    men, once again? Why should ye not? what do ye see, what hear, whereat to
                    falter? What oracle, what portent? Now, by the Gods! methought they spoke of
                    victory and glory. Once more, what do ye fear, or wish? What, in the name of
                    Hecate and Hades! What do ye wait for?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "A leader!" answered the rash Cethegus, excited now even beyond the bounds of
                    ordinary rashness. "A day, a place, a signal!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Have them, then, all," replied the other, still half scornfully. "Lo! I am here
                    to lead; the field of Mars will give a place; the consular elections an
                    occasion; the blood of Cicero a signal!" </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page30">[pg 30]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Be it so!" instantly replied Cethegus; "be it so! thou hast spoken, as the
                    times warrant, boldly; and upon my head be it, that our deeds shall respond to
                    thy daring words, with equal daring!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And a loud hum of general assent succeeded to his stirring accents; and a quick
                    fluttering sound ran through the whole assemblage, as every man, released from
                    the constraint of deep and silent expectation, altered his posture somewhat, and
                    drew a long breath at the close. But the conspirator paused not. He saw
                    immediately the effect which had been made upon the minds of all, by what had
                    passed. He perceived the absolute necessity of following that impulse up to
                    action, before, by a revulsion no less sudden than the late change from
                    despondency to fierceness, their minds should again subside into the lethargy of
                    doubt and dismay. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "But say thou, Sergius," he continued, "how shall it be, and who shall strike
                    the blow that is to seal Rome's liberty, our vengeance?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "First swear we!" answered Cataline. "Læca, the eagle, and the bowl!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Lo! they are here, my Sergius," answered the master of the house, drawing aside
                    a piece of crimson drapery, which covered a small niche or recess in the wall,
                    and displaying by the movement a silver eagle, its pinions wide extended, and
                    its talons grasping a thunderbolt, placed on a pedestal, under a small but
                    exquisitely sculptured shrine of Parian marble. Before the image there stood a
                    votive lamp, fed by the richest oils, a mighty bowl of silver half filled with
                    the red Massic wine, and many <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pateræ</span></span>, or sacrificial
                    vessels of a yet richer metal. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Hear, bird of Mars, and of Quirinus"—cried Cataline, without a pause,
                    stretching his hands toward the glittering effigy—"Hear thou, and be
                    propitious! Thou, who didst all-triumphant guide a yet greater than Quirinus to
                    deeds of might and glory; thou, who wert worshipped by the charging shout of
                    Marius, and consecrated by the gore of Cimbric myriads; thou, who wert erst
                    enshrined on the Capitoline, what time the proud patricians veiled their haughty
                    crests before the conquering plebeian; thou, who shalt sit again sublime upon
                    those ramparts, meet aery for thine unvanquished pinion; shalt drink again
                        liba<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page31">[pg 31]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tions, boundless libations of rich Roman
                    life-blood, hot from patrician hearts, smoking from every kennel! Hear and
                    receive our oaths—listen and be propitious!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He spoke, and seizing from the pedestal a sacrificial knife, which lay beside
                    the bowl, opened a small vein in his arm, and suffered the warm stream to gush
                    into the wine. While the red current was yet flowing, he gave the weapon to
                    Cethegus, and he did likewise, passing it in his turn to the conspirator who
                    stood beside him, and he in like manner to the next, till each one in his turn
                    had shed his blood into the bowl, which now mantled to the brim with a foul and
                    sacrilegious mixture, the richest vintage of the Massic hills, curdled with
                    human gore. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Then filling out a golden goblet for himself, "Hear, God of war," cried
                    Cataline, "unto whose minister and omen we offer daily worship; hear, mighty
                    Mars, the homicide and the avenger; and thou, most ancient goddess, hear,
                    Nemesis! and Hecate, and Hades! and all ye powers of darkness, Furies and Fates,
                    hear ye! For unto ye we swear, never to quench the torch; never to sheath the
                    brand; till all our foes be prostrate, till not one drop shall run in living
                    veins of Rome's patricians; till not one hearth shall warm; one roof shall
                    shelter; till Rome shall be like Carthage, and we, like mighty Marius, lords and
                    spectators of her desolation! We swear! we taste the consecrated cup! and thus
                    may his blood flow, who shall, for pity or for fear, forgive or fail or
                    falter—his own blood, and his wife's, and that of all his race forever! May
                    vultures tear their eyes, yet fluttering with quick vision; may wolves tug at
                    their heart-strings, yet strong with vigorous life; may infamy be their
                    inheritance, and Tartarus receive their spirits!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And while he spoke, he sipped the cup of horror with unreluctant lips, and
                    dashed the goblet with the residue over the pedestal and shrine. And there was
                    not one there who shrank from that foul draught. With ashy cheeks indeed, but
                    knitted brows, and their lips reeking red with the abomination, but fearless and
                    unfaltering, they pledged in clear and solemn tones, each after each, that awful
                    imprecation, and cast their goblets down, that the floor swam in blood; and
                    grasped each others' hands, sworn comrades from that hour even to the gates of
                    hell. </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page32">[pg 32]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A long and impressive silence followed. For every heart there, even of the
                    boldest, recoiled as it were for a moment on itself, not altogether in regret or
                    fear, much less in anything approaching to compunction or remorse; but in a sort
                    of secret horror, that they were now involved beyond all hope of extrication,
                    beyond all possibility of turning back or halting! And Cataline, endowed with
                    almost superhuman shrewdness, and himself quite immovable of purpose, perceived
                    the feelings that actuated all the others—which he felt not, nor cared for—and
                    called on Læca to bring wine. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Wine, comrades," he exclaimed, "pure, generous, noble wine, to wash away the
                    rank drops from our lips, that are more suited to our blades! to make our veins
                    leap cheerily to the blythe inspiration of the God! and last, not least, to
                    guard us from the damps of this sweet chamber, which alone of his bounteous
                    hospitality our Porcius has vouchsafed to us!" And on the instant, the
                    master—for they dared trust no slaves—bore in two earthen vases, one of strong
                    Chian from the Greek Isle of the Egean, the other of Falernian, the fruitiest
                    and richest of the Italian wines, not much unlike the modern sherry, but having
                    still more body, and many cyathi, or drinking cups; but he brought in no water,
                    wherewith the more temperate ancients were wont to mix their heady wines, even
                    in so great a ratio as nine to one of the generous liquor. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Fill now! fill all!" cried Cataline, and with the word he drained a brimming
                    cup. "Rare liquor this, my Marcus," he continued; "whence had'st thou this
                    Falernian? 'tis of thine inmost brand, I doubt not. In whose consulship did it
                    imbibe the smoke?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "The first of Caius Marius." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Forty-four years, a ripe age," said Cethegus, "but twill be better forty years
                    hence. Strange, by the Gods! that of the two best things on earth, women and
                    wine, the nature should so differ. The wine is crude still, when the girl is
                    mellow; but it is ripe, long after she is——" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Rotten, by Venus!"—interposed Cæparius, swearing the harlot's oath; "Rotten,
                    and in the lap of Lamia!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "But heard ye not," asked Cataline, "or hearing, did ye not accept the omen!—in
                    whose first Consulship this same Falernian jar was sealed?" </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page33">[pg 33]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Marius! By Hercules! an omen! oh, may it turn out well!" exclaimed the
                    superstitious Lentulus. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Sayest thou, my Sura? well! drink we to the omen, and may we to the valour and
                    the principles of Marius unite the fortunes of his rival—of all-triumphant
                    Sylla!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A burst of acclamations replied to the happy hit, and seeing now his aim
                    entirely accomplished, Cataline checked the revel; their blood was up; no fear
                    of chilling counsels! </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Now then," he said, "before we drink like boon companions, let us consult like
                    men; there is need now of counsel; that once finished"—— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Fulvia awaits me," interrupted Cassius, "Fulvia, worth fifty revels!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And me <span class="tei tei-sic">Sempronia</span>," lisped the younger and more
                    beautiful of the twin Sylla. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Meanwhile," exclaimed Autronius, "let us comprehend, so shall we need no
                    farther meetings—each of which risks the awakening of suspicion, and it may
                    well be of discovery. Let us now comprehend, that, when the time comes, we may
                    all perform our duty. Speak to us, therefore, Sergius." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> No farther exhortation was required; for coolly the conspirator arose to set
                    before his desperate companions, the plans which he had laid so deeply, that it
                    seemed scarcely possible that they should fail; and not a breath or whisper
                    interrupted him as he proceeded. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Were I not certain of the men," he said, "to whom I speak, I could say many
                    things that should arouse you, so that you should catch with fiery eagerness at
                    aught that promised a more tolerable position. I could recount the luxuries of
                    wealth which you once knew; the agonies of poverty beneath which, to no purpose,
                    you lie groaning. I could point out your actual inability to live, however
                    basely—deprived of character and credit—devoid of any relics of your fortunes!
                    weighed to the very earth by debts, the interest alone of which has swallowed up
                    your patrimonies, and gapes even yet for more! fettered by bail-bonds, to fly
                    which is infamy, and to abide them ruin! shunned, scorned, despised, and hated,
                    if not feared by all men. I could paint, to your very eyes, ourselves in rags or
                    fetters! our enemies in robes of office, seated on curule <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page34">[pg 34]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>chairs, swaying the fate of nations, dispensing by a nod the wealth
                    of plundered provinces! I could reverse the picture. But, as it is, your present
                    miseries and your past deeds dissuade me. Your hopelessness and daring, your
                    wrongs and valor, your injuries and thirst of vengeance, warn me, alike, that
                    words are weak, and exhortation needless. Now understand with me, how matters
                    stand. The stake for which we play, is fair before your eyes:—learn how our
                    throw for it is certain. The consular elections, as you all well know, will be
                    held, as proclaimed already, on the fifteenth day before the calends of
                    November. My rivals are Sulpicius, Muræna, and Silanus. Antonius and Cicero will
                    preside—the first, my friend! a bold and noble Roman! He waits but an occasion
                    to declare for us. Now, mark me. Caius Manlius—you all do know the man, an old
                    and practised soldier, a scar-seamed veteran of Sylla,—will on that very day
                    display yon eagle to twenty thousand men, well armed, and brave, and desperate
                    as ourselves, at Fiesolè. Septimius of Camerinum writes from the Picene
                    district, that thirty thousand slaves will rise there at his bidding; while
                    Caius Julius, sent to that end into Apulia, has given out arms and nominated
                    leaders to twice five thousand there. Ere this, they have received my mandate to
                    collect their forces, and to march on that same day toward Rome. Three several
                    armies, to meet which there is not one legion on this side of Cisalpine Gaul!
                    What, then, even if all were peace in Rome, what then could stand against us?
                    But there shall be that done here, here in the very seat and heart, as I may
                    say, of Empire, that shall dismay and paralyse all who would else oppose us.
                    Cethegus, when the centuries are all assembled in the field of Mars, with
                    fifteen hundred gladiators well armed and exercised even now, sets on the guard
                    in the Janiculum, and beats their standard down. Then, while all is confusion,
                    Statilius and Gabinius with their households,—whom, his work done, Cethegus
                    will join straightway—will fire the city in twelve several places, break open
                    the prison doors, and crying "Liberty to slaves!" and "Abolition of all
                    debts!"—rush diverse throughout the streets, still gathering numbers as they
                    go. Meanwhile, with Lentulus and Cassius, the clients of your houses being armed
                    beneath their togas with swords and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page35">[pg 35]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>breast-plates, and
                    casques ready to be donned, I will make sure of Cicero and the rest. Havoc, and
                    slaughter, and flames every where will make the city ours. Then ye, who have no
                    duty set, hear, and mark this: always to kill is to do something! the more, and
                    nobler, so much the better deed! Remembering this, that sons have ready access
                    to their sires, who for the most part are their bitterest foes! and that to
                    spare none we are sworn—how, and how deeply, it needs not to remind you. More
                    words are bootless, since to all here it must be evident that these things,
                    planned thus far with deep and prudent council, once executed with that
                    dauntless daring, which alone stands for armor, and for weapons, and, by the
                    Gods! for bulwarks of defence, must win us liberty and glory, more over wealth,
                    and luxury, and power, in which names is embraced the sum of all felicity.
                    Therefore, now, I exhort you not; for if the woes which you would shun, the
                    prizes which you shall attain, exhort you not, all words of man, all portents of
                    the Gods, are dumb, and voiceless, and in vain! Mark the day only, and remember,
                    that if not ye, at least your sires were Romans and were men!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Bravely, my Sergius, hast thou spoken, and well done!" cried at once several
                    voices of the more prominent partisans. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "By the Gods! what a leader!" whispered Longinus Cassius to his neighbor. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Fabius in council," cried Cethegus, "Marcellus in the field!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Moreover, fellow-soldiers," exclaimed Lentulus, "hear this: although he join
                    not with us now, through policy, Antonius, the Consul, is in heart ours, and
                    waits but for the first success to declare himself for the cause in arms.
                    Crassus, the rich—Cæsar, the people's idol—have heard our counsels, and
                    approve them. The first blow struck, their influence, their names, their riches,
                    and their popularity, strike with us—trustier friends, by Pollux! and more
                    potent, than fifty thousand swordsmen!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A louder and more general burst of acclamation and applause than that which had
                    succeeded Cataline's address, burst from the lips of all, as those great names
                    dropped from the tongue of Lentulus; and one voice cried aloud—it was the voice
                    of Curius, intoxicated as it were with present triumph— </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page36">[pg 36]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "By all the Gods! Rome is our own! our own, even now, to portion out among our
                    friends, our mistresses, our slaves!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Not Rome—but Rome's inheritance, the world!" exclaimed another. "If we win,
                    all the universe is ours—and see how small the stake; when, if we fail"— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "By Hades, we'll not fail!" Cataline interrupted him, in his deep penetrating
                    tones. "We cannot, and we will not! and now, for I wax somewhat weary, we will
                    break up this conclave. We meet at the comitia!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And the Slave?" whispered Cethegus, with an inquiring accent, in his ear—"the
                    Slave, my Sergius?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Will tell no tales of us," replied the other, with a hoarse laugh, "unless it
                    be to Lamia." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Thus they spoke as they left the house; and ere the day had yet begun to glimmer
                    with the first morning twilight—so darkly did the clouds still muster over the
                    mighty city—went on their different ways toward their several homes, unseen,
                    and, as they fondly fancied, unsuspected. </p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> On the same night, and almost at the same hour of the night, wherein that
                    dreadful conclave was assembled at the house of Læca, a small domestic group,
                    consisting indeed only of three individuals, was gathered in the tablinum, or
                    saloon, of an elegant though modest villa, situate in the outskirts of the city,
                    fronting the street that led over the Mulvian bridge to the Æmilian way, and
                    having a large garden communicating in the rear with the plebeian cemetery on
                    the Esquiline. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was a gay and beautiful apartment, of small dimensions, but replete with all
                    those graceful objects, those manifold appliances of refined taste and pleasure,
                    for which the Romans, austere and poor no longer, had, since their late
                    acquaintance with Athenian polish and Oriental luxury, acquired a
                    predilection—ominous, as their sterner patriots fancied, of personal degeneracy
                    and national decay. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Divided from the hall of reception by thick soft curtains, woven from the choice
                    wool of Calabria, and glowing with the richest hues of the Tyrian crimson; and
                    curtained with hangings of the same costly fabric around the windows, both of
                    which with the doorway opened upon a peristyle; that little chamber wore an air
                    of comfort, that charmed the eye more even than its decorations. Yet these were
                    of no common order; for the floor was tesselated in rare patterns of mosaic
                    work, showing its exquisite devices and bright colors, where they were not
                    concealed by a footstool of embroidered tapestry. The walls were portioned <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page38">[pg 38]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>out into compartments, each framed by a broad border
                    of gilded scroll-work on a crimson ground, and containing an elaborately
                    finished fresco painting; which, could they have been seen by any critical eye
                    of modern days, would have set at rest for ever the question as to the state of
                    this art among the ancients. The subject was a favorite one with all artists of
                    all ages,—from the world-famous Iliad: the story of the goddess-born Achilles.
                    Here tutored by the wise Centaur, Chiron, in horsemanship and archery, and all
                    that makes a hero; here tearing off the virgin mitre, to don the glittering
                    casque proffered, with sword and buckler, among effeminate wares, by the
                    disguised Ulysses; there wandering in the despondent gloom of injured pride
                    along the stormy sea, meet listener to his haughty sorrows, while in the
                    distance, turning her tearful eyes back to her lord, Briseis went unwilling at
                    the behest of the unwilling heralds. Again he was presented, mourning with
                    frantic grief over the corpse of his beloved Patroclus—grief that called up his
                    Nereid mother from the blue depths of her native element; and, in the last,
                    chasing with unexampled speed the flying Hector, who, stunned and destined by
                    the Gods to ruin, dared not await his onset, while Priam veiled his face upon
                    the ramparts, and Hecuba already tore her hair, presaging the destruction of
                    Troy's invincible unshaken column.<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a></p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A small wood fire blazed cheerfully upon the hearth, round which were clustered,
                    in uncouth attitudes of old Etruscan sculpture, the grim and grotesque figures
                    of the household Gods. Two lamps of bronze, each with four burners, placed on
                    tall candelabra exquisitely carved in the same metal, diffused a soft calm
                    radiance through the room, accompanied by an aromatic odor from the perfumed
                    vegetable oil which fed their light. Upon a circular table of dark-grained
                    citrean wood, inlaid with ivory and silver, were several rolls of parchment and
                    papyrus, the books of the day, some of them splendidly emblazoned and
                    illuminated; a lyre of tortoiseshell, and near to it the slender plectrum by
                    which its cords were wakened to melody. Two or three little flasks of agate and
                    of onyx containing some choice perfumes, a Tuscan vase full of fresh-gathered
                    flowers, and several articles yet more decidedly feminine, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page39">[pg 39]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>were scattered on the board; needles, and thread of various hues,
                    and twine of gold and silver, and some embroidery, half finished, and as it
                    would seem but that instant laid aside. Such was the aspect of the saloon
                    wherein three persons were sitting on that night; who, though they were
                    unconscious, nay, even unsuspicious of the existence of conspiracy and treason,
                    were destined, ere many days should elapse, to be involved in its desperate
                    mazes; to act conspicuous parts and undergo strange perils, in the dread drama
                    of the times. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They were of different years and sex—one, a magnificent and stately matron,
                    such as Rome's matrons were when Rome was at the proudest, already well advanced
                    in years, yet still possessing not merely the remains of former charms, but much
                    of real beauty, and that too of the noblest and most exalted order. Her hair,
                    which had been black in her youth as the raven's wing, was still, though mixed
                    with many a line of silver, luxuriant and profuse as ever. Simply and closely
                    braided over her broad and intellectual temples, and gathered into a thick knot
                    behind, it displayed admirably the contour of her head, and suited the severe
                    and classic style of her strictly Roman features. The straight-cut eye-brows,
                    the clear and piercing eye, the aquiline nose, and the firm thin lips, spoke
                    worlds of character and decision; yet that which might have otherwise seemed
                    stern and even harsh, was softened by a smile of singular sweetness, and by a
                    lighting up of the whole countenance, which at times imparted to those high
                    features an expression of benevolence, gentle and feminine in the extreme. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Her stature was well suited to the style of her lineaments; majestically tall
                    and stately, and though attenuated something by the near approach of old age,
                    preserving still the soft and flowing outlines of a form, which had in youth
                    been noted for roundness and voluptuous symmetry. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> She wore the plain white robes, bordered and zoned with crimson, of a patrician
                    lady, but save one massive signet on the third finger of her right hand she had
                    no gem or ornament whatever; and as she sat a little way aloof from her younger
                    companions, drawing the slender threads with many a graceful motion from the
                    revolving distaff into the basket by her side, she might have passed for her,
                    whose <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page40">[pg 40]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>proud prayer, that she might be known not as the
                    daughter of the Scipios but as the mother of the Gracchi, was but too fatally
                    fulfilled in the death-earned celebrity of those her boasted jewels. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The other lady was smaller, slighter, fairer, and altogether so different in
                    mien, complexion, stature, and expression, that it was difficult even for those
                    who knew them well to believe that they were a mother and her only child. For
                    even in her flush of beauty, the elder lady, while in the full splendor of
                    Italian womanhood, must ever have been calculated to inspire admiration, not all
                    unmixed with awe, rather than tenderness or love. The daughter, on the other
                    hand, was one whose every gesture, smile, word, glance, bespoke that passion
                    latent in itself, which it awakened in the bosom of all beholders. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Slightly above the middle stature, and with a waist of scarce a span's
                    circumference, her form was exquisitely full and rounded; the sweeping outlines
                    of her snow-white and dimpled arms, bare to the shoulders, and set off by many
                    strings of pearl, which were themselves scarcely whiter than the skin on which
                    they rested; the swan-like curvature of the dazzling neck; the wavy and
                    voluptuous development of her bust, shrouded but not concealed by the plaits of
                    her white linen <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">stola</span></span>, fastened on either shoulder by a
                    clasp of golden fillagree, and gathered just above her hips by a gilt zone of
                    the Grecian fashion; the small and shapely foot, which peered out with its
                    jewelled sandal under her gold-fringed draperies; combined to present to the eye
                    a very incarnation of that ideal loveliness, which haunts enamored poets in
                    their dreams, the girl just bursting out of girlhood, the glowing Hebe of the
                    soft and sunny south. But if her form was lovely, how shall the pen of mortal
                    describe the wild romantic beauty of her soul-speaking features. The rich
                    redundancy of her dark auburn hair, black where the shadows rested on it as the
                    sable locks of night, but glittering out wherever a wandering ray glanced on its
                    glossy surface like the bright tresses of Aurora. The broad and marble forehead,
                    the pencilled brows, and the large liquid eyes fraught with a mild and lustrous
                    languor; the cheeks, pale in their wonted mood as alabaster, yet eloquent at
                    times with warm and passionate blushes. The lips, redder than aught on earth
                    which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page41">[pg 41]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>shares both hue and softness; and, more than
                    all, the deep and indescribable expression which genius prints on every
                    lineament of those, who claim that rarest and most godlike of endowments. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> She was a thing to dream of, not describe; to dream of in some faint and
                    breathless eve of early summer, beside the margin of some haunted streamlet,
                    beneath the shade of twilight boughs in which the fitful breeze awakes that
                    whispering melody, believed by the poetic ancients to be the chorus of the
                    wood-nymph; to dream of and adore—even as she was adored by him who sat beside
                    her, and watched each varying expression, that swept across her speaking
                    features; and hung upon each accent of the low silvery voice, as if he feared it
                    were the last to which his soul should thrill responsive. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He was a tall and powerful youth of twenty-four or five years; yet, though his
                    limbs were sinewy and lithe, and though his deep round chest, thin flanks, and
                    muscular shoulders gave token of much growing strength, it was still evident
                    that, his stature having been prematurely gained, he lacked much of that degree
                    of power of which his frame gave promise. For though his limbs were well formed
                    they were scarcely set, or furnished, as we should say in speaking of an animal;
                    and the strength, which he in truth possessed, was that of elasticity and
                    youthful vigor, capable rather of violent though brief exertion, than that
                    severe and trained robustness, which can for long continuous periods sustain the
                    strongest and most trying labor. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> His hair was dark and curling—his eye bright, clear, and penetrating; yet was
                    its glance at times wavering and undetermined, such as would indicate perhaps a
                    want of steadiness of purpose, not of corporeal resolution, for that was
                    disproved by one glance at the decided curve of his bold clean-cut mouth, and
                    the square outlines of his massive jaw, which seemed almost to betoken
                    fierceness. There was a quick short flash at times, keen as the falcon's, in the
                    unsteady eye, that told of energy enough within and stirring spirit to prompt
                    daring deeds, the momentary irresolution conquered. There was a frank and cheery
                    smile that oftentimes belied the auguries drawn from the other features; and,
                    more than all, there was a tranquil sweet expression, which now and then
                    pervaded the whole <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page42">[pg 42]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>countenance, altering for the
                    better its entire character, and betokening more mind and deeper feelings, than
                    would at first have been suspected from his aspect. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> His dress was the ordinary tunic of the day, of plain white woollen stuff,
                    belted about the middle by a girdle, which contained his ivory tablets, and the
                    metallic pencil used for writing on their waxed surface, together with his
                    handkerchief and purse; but nothing bearing the semblance of a weapon, not so
                    much even as a common knife. His legs and arms were bare, his feet being
                    protected merely by sandals of fine leather having the clasps or fibulæ of gold;
                    as was the buckle of his girdle, and one huge signet ring, which was his only
                    ornament. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> His toga, which had been laid aside on entering the saloon, as was the custom of
                    the Romans in their own families, or among private friends, hung on the back of
                    an armed chair; of ample size and fine material, but undistinguished by the
                    marks of senatorial or equestrian rank. Such was the aspect, such the bearing of
                    the youth, who might be safely deemed the girl's permitted suitor, from his
                    whole air and manner, as he listened to the soft voice of his beautiful
                    mistress. For as they sat there side by side, perusing from an illuminated
                    scroll the elegies of some long-perished, long-forgotten poet, now reading
                    audibly the smooth and honeyed lines, now commenting with playful criticism on
                    the style, or carrying out with all the fervor and romance of young poetical
                    temperament the half obscure allusions of the bard, no one could doubt that they
                    were lovers; especially if he marked the calm and well-pleased smile that stole
                    from time to time across the proud features of that patrician lady; who, sitting
                    but a little way apart, watched—while she reeled off skein after skein of the
                    fine Byssine flax in silence—the quiet happiness of the young pair. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Thus had the evening passed, not long nor tediously to any of the party; and
                    midnight was at hand; when there entered from the atrium a grey-headed slave
                    bearing a tray covered with light refreshments—fresh herbs, endive and mallows
                    sprinkled with snow, ripe figs, eggs and anchovies, dried grapes, and cakes of
                    candied honey; while two boys of rare beauty followed, one carrying a flagon of
                    Chian wine diluted with snow water, the other a platter <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page43">[pg 43]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>richly chased in gold covered with cyathi, or drinking cups, some of plain
                    chrystal, some of that unknown myrrhine fabric,<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> which is believed by many scholars to
                    have been highly vitrified and half-transparent porcelain. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A second slave brought in a folded stand, like a camp stool in shape, on which
                    the tray was speedily deposited, while on a slab of Parian marble near which the
                    two boys took their stand, the wine and goblets were arranged in glittering
                    order. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> So silently, however, was all this done, that, their preparations made, the
                    elder slaves had retired with a deep genuflexion, leaving the boys only to
                    administer at that unceremonious banquet, ere the young couple, whose backs were
                    turned towards the table, perceived the interruption. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The brilliant smile, which has been mentioned, beamed from the features of the
                    elder lady, as she perceived how thoroughly engrossed, even to the
                    unconsciousness of any passing sound, they were, whom, rising for the purpose,
                    and laying by her work, she now proceeded to recall to sublunary matters. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Paullus," she said, "and you, my Julia, ye are unconscious how the fleeting
                    hours have slipped away. The night hath far advanced into the third watch. I
                    would not part ye needlessly, nor over soon, especially when you must so soon
                    perforce be severed; but we must not forget how long a homeward walk awaits our
                    dear Arvina. Come, then, and partake some slight refreshment, before you say
                    farewell. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "How thoughtless in me, to have detained you thus, and with a mile to walk this
                    murky and unpleasant <span class="tei tei-corr">night.</span> They say, too, that the
                    streets are dangerous of late, haunted by dissolute night-revellers—that
                    villain Clodius and his infamous co-mates. I tremble like a leaf if I but meet
                    them in broad day—and what if you should fall in with them, when flushed with
                    wine, and ripe for any outrage?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Fie! dear one, fie!" answered the young man with a smile—"a sorry soldier
                    wouldst thou make of me, who am within so short a space to meet the savages of
                    Pontus, under our mighty Pompey! There is no danger, Julia, here in the heart of
                    Rome; and my stout freedman Thrasea <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page44">[pg 44]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>awaits me with his
                    torch. Nor is it so far either to my house, for those who cross, as I shall do,
                    the cemetery on the Esquiline. 'Tis but a step across the sumptuous Carinæ to
                    the Cælian." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "But surely, surely, Paul," exclaimed the lovely girl, laying her hand upon his
                    arm, "thou wouldst not cross that fearful burying-ground, haunted by all things
                    awful and obscene, thus at the dead of night. Oh! do not, dearest," she
                    continued, "thou knowest not what wild terrible tales are rife, of sounds and
                    sights unnatural and superhuman, encountered in those loathsome precincts. 'Tis
                    a mere tempting of the Dark Ones, to brave the horrors of that place!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "The Gods, my Julia," replied the youth unmoved by her alarm, "the Gods are
                    never absent from their votaries, so they be innocent and pure of spirit. For
                    me! I am unconscious of a wilful fault, and fear not anything." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Well said, Paullus Arvina," exclaimed the elder lady, "and worthily of your
                    descent from the Cæcilii"—for from that noble house his family indeed derived
                    its origin. "But, although I," she added, "counsel you not to heed our Julia's
                    girlish terrors, I love you not to walk by night so slenderly accompanied. Ho!
                    boy, go summon me the steward, and bid him straightway arm four of the Thracian
                    slaves." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No! by the Gods, Hortensia!" the young man interrupted her, his whole face
                    flushing with excitement, "you do shame to my manhood, by your caution. There is
                    in truth no shadow of danger. Besides," he added, laughing at his own
                    impetuosity, "I shall be far beyond the Esquiline ere excellent old Davus could
                    rouse those sturdy knaves of yours, or find the armory key; for lo! I will but
                    tarry to taste one cup of your choice of Chian to my Julia's health, and then
                    straight homeward. Have a care, my fair boy, that flagon is too heavy to be
                    lifted safely by such small hands as thine, and its contents too precious to be
                    wasted. Soh! that's well done; thou'lt prove a second Ganymede! Health, Julia,
                    and good dreams—may all fair things attend thee, until we meet again." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And when shall that be, Paul," whispered his mistress, a momentary flush
                    shooting across brow, neck, and bosom, as she spoke, and leaving her, a second
                    afterward, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page45">[pg 45]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>even paler than her wont, between anxiety
                    and fear, and the pain even of this temporary parting—"when shall that be?
                    to-morrow?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Surely, to-morrow! fairest," he replied, clasping her little hand with a fond
                    pressure, "unless, which may the Gods avert! anything unforeseen prevent me.
                    Give me my toga, boy," he added, "and see if Thrasea waits, and if his torch be
                    lighted." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Bid him come hither, Geta," Hortensia interposed, addressing the boy as he left
                    the room, "and tell old Davus to accompany him, bringing the keys of the
                    peristyle and of the garden gate. So shalt thou gain the Esquiline more easily." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Her orders were obeyed as soon as they were spoken, and but few moments
                    intervened before the aged steward, and the freedman with his staff and torch,
                    the latter so prepared by an art common to the ancients as to set almost any
                    violence of wind or rain at defiance, stood waiting their commands. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Familiar and kind words were interchanged between those high-born ladies and the
                    trustworthy follower of young Arvina. For those were days, when no cold
                    etiquette fettered the freedom of the tongue, and when no rank, how stately or
                    how proud soever, induced austerity of bearing or haughtiness toward inferiors;
                    and these concluded, greetings, briefer but far more warm, followed between the
                    master and his intended bride. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Sweet slumbers, Julia, and a happy wakening attend you! Farewell, Hortensia;
                    both of ye farewell!" and passing into the colonnade through the door which
                    Davus had unlocked, he drew the lappet of his toga over his head after the
                    fashion of a hood to shield it from the drizzling rain—for, except on a
                    journey, the hardy Romans never wore any hat or headgear—and hastened with a
                    firm and regular step along the marble peristyle. This portico, or rather
                    piazza, enclosed, by a double row of Tuscan columns, a few small flower beds,
                    and a fountain springing high in the air from the conch of a Triton, and falling
                    back into a large shell of white marble, which it was so contrived as to keep
                    ever full without at any time overflowing. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Beyond this was a summer triclinium or dining room facing the north, and
                    provided with the three-sided couch, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page46">[pg 46]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>from which it
                    took its name, embracing a circular table. Through this they passed into a
                    smaller court adorned like the other by a jet d'eau, surrounded by several small
                    boudoirs and bed chambers luxuriously decorated, which were set apart to the use
                    of the females of the family, and guarded night and day by the most trusty of
                    the slaves. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Hence a strong door gave access to a walled space, throughout the length of
                    which on either hand ran a long range of offices, and above them the dormitories
                    of the slaves, with a small porter's lodge or guard room by the gate, opening on
                    the orchard in the rear. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Therein were stationed the four Thracians, mentioned by Hortensia, whose duty it
                    was to keep watch alternately over the safety of the postern, although the key
                    was not entrusted to their charge; and he, whose watch it was, started up from a
                    bench on which he had been stretched, and looked forth torch in hand at the
                    sound of approaching footsteps. Seeing, however, who it was, and that the
                    steward attended him, he lent his aid in opening the postern, and reverently
                    bowed the knee to Arvina, as he departed from the hospitable villa. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The orchard through which lay his onward progress, occupied a considerable
                    extent of ground, laid out in terraces adorned with marble urns and statues,
                    long bowery walks sheltered by vine-clad trellices, and rows of fruit trees
                    interspersed with many a shadowy clump of the rich evergreen holm-oak, the
                    tufted stone-pine, the clustering arbutus, and smooth-leaved laurestinus. This
                    lovely spot was separated from the plebeian cemetery only—as has been said
                    already—by a low wall; and therefore in those days of universal superstition of
                    the lower orders and the slaves, and many too of their employers, would have
                    eschewed it as a place ominous of evil, if not unsafe and perilous. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The mind of Paul, however, if not entirely free from any touch of superstitious
                    awe, which at that period of the world would have been a thing altogether
                    unnatural and impossible, was at least of too firm a mould to shake at mere
                    imaginary terrors; and he strode on, lighted by his torch-bearer, through the
                    dark mazes of the orchard, with all his thoughts engrossed by the pleasant
                    reminiscences of the past evening. Thoughtless, however, as he was, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page47">[pg 47]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and bold, he yet recoiled a step, and the blood rushed
                    tumultuously to his heart, as a loud yelling cry, protracted strangely, and
                    ending in a sound midway between a groan and a burst of horrid laughter, rose
                    awfully upon the silent night; and it required an effort to man his heart
                    against a feeling, which crept through him, nearly akin to fear. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But with the freedman Thrasea it was a very different matter, for he shook so
                    much with absolute terror, that he had well nigh dropped the torch; while,
                    drawing nearer to his master's side, with teeth that chattered as if in an ague
                    fit, and a face deserted by every particle of color, he besought him in
                    faltering accents, "by all the Gods! to turn back instantly, lest evil might
                    come of it!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> His entreaties were, however, of no avail with the brave youth, who in a moment
                    had shaken off his transitory terror, and was now resolute, not only to proceed
                    on his homeward route, but to investigate the cause and meaning of the outcry. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Silence!" he said, somewhat sternly, in answer to the reiterated prayers of the
                    trembling servitor, "Silence! and follow, idiot! That was no superhuman
                    voice—no yell of nightly lemures, but the death-cry, if I err not more widely,
                    of some frail mortal like ourselves. There may be time, however, yet to save
                    him, and I so truly marked the quarter whence it rose, that I doubt not we may
                    discover him. Advance the light; lo! we are at the wall. Lower thy torch now,
                    that I may undo the wicket. Give me thy club and keep close at my heels bearing
                    the flambeau high!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And with the words he strode out rapidly into the wide desolate expanse of the
                    plebeian grave yard. It was a broad bleak space, comprising the whole table land
                    and southern slope of the Esquiline hill, broken with many deep ravines and
                    gulleys, worn by the wintry rains, covered with deep rank grass and stunted
                    bushes, with here and there a grove of towering cypresses, or dark funereal
                    yews, casting a deeper shadow over the gloomy solitude. So rough and broken was
                    the surface of the ground, so numerous the low mounds which alone covered the
                    ashes of the humbler dead, that they were long in reaching the vicinity of the
                    spot where that fell deed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page48">[pg 48]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>had been done so recently.
                    When they had come, however, to the foot of the descent, where it swept gently
                    downward to the boundary wall, the young man took the torch from his attendant,
                    and waving it with a slow movement to and fro, surveyed the ground with close
                    and narrow scrutiny. He had not moved in this manner above a dozen paces, before
                    a bright quick flash seemed to shoot up from the long thick herbage as the glare
                    of the torch passed over it. Another step revealed the nature and the cause of
                    that brief gleam; a ray had fallen full on the polished blade of Cataline's
                    stiletto, which lay, where it had been cast by the expiring effort of the
                    victim, hilt downward in the tangled weeds. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He seized it eagerly, but shuddered, as he beheld the fresh dark gore curdling
                    on the broad steel, and clotted round the golden guard of the rich weapon. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ha!" he exclaimed, "I am right, Thrasea. Foul murder hath been done here! Let
                    us look farther." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Several minutes now were spent in searching every foot of ground, and prying
                    even into the open vaults of several broken graves; for at first they had taken
                    a wrong direction in the gloom. Quickly, however, seeing that he was in error,
                    Arvina turned upon his traces, and was almost immediately successful; for there,
                    scarce twenty feet from the spot where he had found the dagger, with his grim
                    gory face turned upward as if reproachfully to the dark quiet skies, the black
                    death-sweat still beaded on his frowning brow, and a sardonic grin distorting
                    his pale lips, lay the dead slave. Flat on his back, with his arms stretched out
                    right and left, his legs extended close together to their full length, he lay
                    even as he had fallen; for not a struggle had convulsed his limbs after he
                    struck the earth; life having actually fled while he yet stood erect, battling
                    with all the energies of soul and body against man's latest enemy. The bosom of
                    his gray tunic, rent asunder, displayed the deep gash which had let out the
                    spirit, whence the last drops of the thick crimson life-blood were ebbing with a
                    slow half-stagnant motion. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> On this dread sight Paul was still gazing in that motionless and painful
                    silence, with which the boldest cannot fail to look upon the body of a fellow
                    creature from which the immortal soul has been reluctantly and forcefully ex<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page49">[pg 49]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>pelled, when a loud cry from Thrasea, who, having
                    lagged a step or two behind, was later in discovering the corpse, aroused him
                    from his melancholy stupor. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Alas! alas! ah me!" cried the half-sobbing freedman, "my friend, my more than
                    friend, my countryman, my kinsman, Medon!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ha! dost thou recognize the features? didst thou know him who lies so coldly
                    and inanimately here before us?" cried the excited youth, "whose slave was he?
                    speak, Thrasea, on thy life! this shall be looked to straightway; and, by the
                    Gods! avenged." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "As I would recognize mine own in the polished brass, as I do know my father's
                    sister's son! for such was he, who lies thus foully slaughtered. Alas! alas! my
                    countryman! wo! wo! for thee, my Medon! Many a day, alas! many a happy day have
                    we two chased the elk and urus by the dark-wooded Danube; the same roof covered
                    us; the same board fed; the same fire warmed us; nay! the same fatal
                    battle-field robbed both of liberty and country. Yet were the great Gods
                    merciful to the poor captives. Thy father did buy me, Arvina, and a few years of
                    light and pleasant servitude restored the slave to freedom. Medon was purchased
                    by the wise consul, Cicero, and was to have received his freedom at the next
                    Saturnalia. Alas! and wo is me, he is now free forever from any toils on earth,
                    from any mortal master." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Nay! weep not so, my Thrasea," exclaimed the generous youth, laying his left
                    hand with a friendly pressure on the freedman's shoulder, "thou shalt have all
                    means to do all honor to his name; all that can now be done by mortals for the
                    revered and sacred dead. Aid me now to remove the body, lest those who slew him
                    may return, and carry off the evidences of their crime." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Thus speaking, he thrust the unlighted end of the torch into the ground, and
                    lifting up the shoulders of the carcase, while Thrasea raised the feet, bore it
                    away a hundred yards or better, and laying it within the open arch-way of an old
                    tomb, covered the mouth with several boughs torn from a neighboring cypress. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Then satisfied that it would thus escape a nearer search than it was likely
                    would be made by the murderers, when <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page50">[pg 50]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>they should find
                    that it had been removed, he walked away very rapidly toward his home. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Before he left the burial ground, however, he wiped the dagger carefully in the
                    long grass, and hid it in the bosom of his tunic. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> No more words were exchanged—the master buried in deep thought, the servant
                    stupified with grief and terror—until they reached the house of Paullus, in a
                    fair quarter of the town, near to the street of Carinæ, the noblest and most
                    sumptuous in Rome. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A dozen slaves appeared within the hall, awaiting the return of their young
                    lord, but he dismissed them all; and when they had departed, taking a small
                    night lamp, and ordering Thrasea to waken him betimes to-morrow, that he might
                    see the consul, he bade him be of good cheer, for that Medon's death should
                    surely be avenged, since the gay dagger would prove a clue to the detection of
                    his slayer. Then, passing into his own chamber, he soon lost all recollection of
                    his hopes, joys, cares, in the sound sleep of innocence and youth. </p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The morning was yet young, when Paullus Arvina, leaving his mansion on the
                    Cælian hill by a postern door, so to avoid the crowd of clients who even at that
                    early hour awaited his forth-coming in the hall, descended the gentle hill
                    toward the splendid street called Carinæ, from some fanciful resemblance in its
                    shape, lying in a curved hollow between the bases of the Esquiline, Cælian, and
                    Palatine mounts, to the keel of a galley. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> This quarter of the city was at that time unquestionably the most beautiful in
                    Rome, although it still fell far short of the magnificence it afterward
                    attained, when the favourite Mecænas had built his splendid palace, and laid out
                    his unrivalled gardens, on the now woody Esquiline; and it would have been
                    difficult indeed to conceive a view more sublime, than that which lay before the
                    eyes of the young patrician, as he paused for a moment on the highest terrace of
                    the hill, to inhale the breath of the pure autumnal morning. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The sun already risen, though not yet high in the east, was pouring a flood of
                    mellow golden light, through the soft medium of the half misty atmosphere, over
                    the varied surface of the great city, broken and diversified by many hills and
                    hollows; and bringing out the innumerable columns, arches, and aqueducts, that
                    adorned almost every street and square, in beautiful relief. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The point at which the young man stood, looking directly northward, was one
                    which could not be excelled, if it <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page52">[pg 52]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>indeed could be
                    equalled for the view it commanded, embracing nearly the whole of Rome, which
                    from its commanding height, inferior only to the capitol, and the Quirinal hill,
                    it was enabled to overlook. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Before him, in the hollow at his feet, on which the morning rays dwelt lovingly,
                    streaming in through the deep valley to the right over the city walls, lay the
                    long street of the Carinæ, the noblest and most sumptuous of Rome, adorned with
                    many residences of the patrician order, and among others, those of Pompey,
                    Cæsar, and the great Latin orator. This broad and noble thoroughfare, from its
                    great width, and the long rows of marble columns, which decked its palaces, all
                    glittering in the misty sunbeams, shewed like a waving line of light among the
                    crowded buildings of the narrower ways, that ran parallel to it along the valley
                    and up the easy slope of the Cælian mount, with the Minervium, in which Arvina
                    stood, leading directly downward to its centre. Beyond this sparkling line, rose
                    the twin summits Oppius and Cispius, of the Esquiline hill, still decked with
                    the dark foliage of the ancestral groves of oak and sweet-chesnut, said to
                    derive their origin from Servius Tullius, the sixth king of Rome, and green with
                    the long grass and towering cypresses of the plebeian cemetery, across which the
                    young man had come home, from the villa of his lady-love, but a few hours
                    before. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Beyond the double hill-tops, a heavy purple shadow indicated the deep basin
                    through which ran the ill-famed Suburra, and the "Wicked-Street", so named from
                    the tradition, that therein Tullia compelled her trembling charioteer to lash
                    his reluctant steeds over the yet warm body of her murdered father. And beyond
                    this again the lofty ridge of the Quirinal mount stood out in fair relief with
                    all its gorgeous load of palaces and columns; and the great temple of the city's
                    founder, the god Romulus Quirinus; and the stupendous range of walls and
                    turrets, along its northern verge, flashing out splendidly to the new-risen sun. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> So lofty was the post from which Paullus gazed, as he overlooked the mighty
                    town, that his eye reached even beyond the city-walls on the Quirinal, and
                    passing over the broad valley at its northern base, all glimmering with
                    uncertain lights and misty shadows, rested upon the Collis Hortulorum, or mount
                    of gardens, now called Monte Pincio, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page53">[pg 53]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>which was at that
                    time covered, as its name indicates, with rich and fertile shrubberies. The
                    glowing hues of these could be distinctly made out, even at this great distance,
                    by the naked eye. For it must be remembered that there was in those days no
                    sea-coal to send up its murky smoke-wreaths, blurring the bright skies with its
                    inky pall; no factories with tall chimnies, vomiting forth, like mimic Etnas,
                    their pestilential breath, fatal to vegetable life. Not a cloud hung over the
                    great city; and the charcoal, sparingly used for cookery, sent forth no visible
                    fumes to shroud the daylight. So that, as the thin purplish haze was dispersed
                    by the growing influence of the sunbeams, every line of the far architecture,
                    even to the carved friezes of the thousand temples, and the rich foliage of the
                    marble capitals could be observed, distinct and sharp as in a painted picture. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Nor was this all the charm of the delicious atmosphere; for so pure was it, that
                    the odours of that flowery hill, wafted upon the wings of the light northern
                    breeze, blent with the coolness which they caught from the hundreds of clear
                    fountains, plashing and glittering in every public place, came to the brow of
                    the young noble, more like the breath of some enchanted garden in the far-famed
                    Hesperides, than the steam from the abodes of above a million of busy mortals. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Before him still, though inclining a little to the left hand, lay a broader
                    hollow, presenting the long vista of the sacred way, leading directly to the
                    capitol, and thence to the Campus Martius, the green expanse of which, bedecked
                    with many a marble monument and brazen column, and already studded with quick
                    moving groups, hurling the disc and javelin, or reining the fierce war-horse
                    with strong Gaulish curbs, lay soft and level for half a league in length, till
                    it was bounded far away by a gleaming reach of the blue Tiber. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Still to the left of this, uprose the Palatine, the earliest settled of the
                    hills of Rome, with the old walls of Romulus, and the low straw-built shed,
                    wherein that mighty son of Mars dwelt when he governed his wild robber-clan; and
                    the bidental marking the spot where lightning from the monarch of Olympus,
                    called on by undue rites, consumed Hostilius and his house; were still preserved
                    with reverential worship, and on its eastern peak, the time-honoured shrine of
                    Stator Jove. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page54">[pg 54]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>The ragged crest of this antique elevation concealed,
                    it is true, from sight the immortal space below, once occupied by the marsh of
                    the Velabrum, but now filled by the grand basilicæ and halls of Justice
                    surrounding the great Roman forum, with all their pomp of golden shields, and
                    monuments of mighty deeds performed in the earliest ages; but it was far too low
                    to intercept the view of the grand Capitol, and the Tarpeian Rock. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The gilded gates of bronze and the gold-plated roof of the vast national
                    temple—gold-plated at the enormous cost of twenty-one thousand talents, the
                    rich spoil of Carthage—the shrine of Jupiter Capitoline, and Juno, and Minerva,
                    sent back the sun-beams in lines too <span class="tei tei-sic">dazzling</span> to be
                    borne by any human eye; and all the pomp of statues grouped on the marble
                    terraces, and guarding the ascent of the celebrated hundred steps, glittered
                    like forms of indurated snow. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Such was the wondrous spectacle, more like a fairy show than a real scene of
                    earthly splendour, to look on which Arvina paused for one moment with exulting
                    gladness, before descending toward the mansion of the consul. Nor was that
                    mighty panorama wanting in moving crowds, and figures suitable to the romantic
                    glory of its scenery. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Here, through the larger streets, vast herds of cattle were driven in by mounted
                    herdsmen, lowing and trampling toward the forum; here a concourse of men, clad
                    in the graceful toga, the clients of some noble house, were hastening along to
                    salute their patron at his morning levee; there again, danced and sang, with
                    saffron colored veils and flowery garlands, a band of virgins passing in sacred
                    pomp toward some favourite shrine; there in sad order swept along, with mourners
                    and musicians, with <span class="tei tei-sic">women</span> wildly shrieking and tearing
                    their long hair, and players and buffoons, and liberated slaves wearing the cap
                    of freedom, a funeral procession, bearing the body of some <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">young</span></span> victim, as indicated by the morning hour, to the funereal pile
                    beyond the city walls; and far off, filing in, with the spear heads and eagles
                    of a cohort glittering above the dust wreaths, by the Flaminian way, the train
                    of some ambassador or envoy, sent by submissive monarchs or dependent states, to
                    sue the favour and protection of the great Roman people. </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page55">[pg 55]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The blended sounds swept up, in a confused sonorous murmur, like the sea; the
                    shrill cry of the water-carriers, and the wild chant of the choral songs, and
                    the keen clangour of the distant trumpets ringing above the din, until the ears
                    of the youth, as well as his eyes, were filled with present proofs of his native
                    city's grandeur; and his whole soul was lapped in the proud conscious joy,
                    arising from the thought that he too was entitled to that boastful name, higher
                    than any monarch's style, of Roman citizen. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Fairest and noblest city of the universe," cried the enthusiastic boy,
                    spreading his arms abroad over the glorious view, which, kindling all the powers
                    of his imaginative mind, had awakened something of awe and veneration, "long may
                    the everliving gods watch over thee; long may they guard thy liberties intact,
                    thy hosts unconquered! long may thy name throughout the world be <span class="tei tei-sic">synonymous</span> with all that is great, and good, and
                    glorious! Long may the Roman fortune and the Roman virtue tread, side by side,
                    upon the neck of tyrants; and the whole universe stand mute and daunted before
                    the presence of the sovereign people." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "The sovereign slaves!" said a deep voice, with a strangely sneering accent, in
                    his ear; and as he started in amazement, for he had not imagined that any one
                    was near him, Cataline stood at his elbow. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Under the mingled influence of surprise, and bashfulness at being overheard, and
                    something not very far removed from alarm at the unexpected presence of one so
                    famed for evil deeds as the man beside him, Arvina recoiled a pace or two, and
                    thrust his hand into the bosom of his toga, disarranging its folds for a moment,
                    and suffering the eye of the conspirator to dwell on the hilt of a weapon, which
                    he recognized instantly as the stiletto he had lost in the struggle with the
                    miserable slave on the Esquiline. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> No gleam in the eye of the wily plotter betrayed his intelligence; no show of
                    emotion was discoverable in his dark paleness; but a grim smile played over his
                    lips for a moment, as he noted, not altogether without a sort of secret
                    satisfaction, the dismay caused by his unexpected presence. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "How now," he said jeeringly, before the smile had yet vanished from his
                    ill-omened face—"what aileth the bold <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page56">[pg 56]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Paullus, that
                    he should start, like an unruly colt scared by a shadow, from the approach of a
                    friend?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "A friend," answered the young man in a half doubtful tone, but instantly
                    recovering himself, "Ha! Cataline, I was surprised, and scarce saw who it was.
                    Thou art abroad betimes this morning. Whither so early? but what saidst thou
                    about slaves?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I thought thou didst not know me," replied the other, "and for the rest, I am
                    abroad no earlier than thou, and am perhaps bound to the same place with thee!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "By Hercules! I fancy not," said Paullus. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Wherefore, I pray thee, <span class="tei tei-corr">not?</span> Who knoweth?
                    Perchance I go to pay my vows to Jupiter upon the capitol! perchance," he added
                    with a deep sneer, "to salute our most eloquent and noble consul!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A crimson flush shot instantly across the face and temples of Arvina, perceiving
                    that he was tampered with, and sounded only; yet he replied calmly and with
                    dignity, "Thither indeed, go I; but I knew not that thou wert in so much a
                    friend of Cicero, as to go visit him." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Men sometimes visit those who be not their friends," answered the other. "I
                    never said he was a friend to me, or I to him. By the gods, no! I had lied
                    else." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "But what was that," asked the youth, moved, by an inexplicable curiosity and
                    excitement, to learn something more of the singular being with whom chance had
                    brought him into contact, "which thou didst say but now concerning slaves?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "That all these whom we see before us, and around us, and beneath us, are but a
                    herd of slaves; gulled and vainglorious slaves!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "The Roman people?" exclaimed Paullus, every tone of his voice, every feature of
                    his fine countenance, expressing his unmitigated horror and astonishment. "The
                    great, unconquered Roman people; the lords of earth and sea, from frosty
                    Caucasus to the twin rocks of Hercules; the tramplers on the necks of kings; the
                    arbiters of the whole world! The Roman people, slaves?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Most abject and most wretched!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "To whom then?" cried the young man, much excited, "to whom am I, art thou, a
                    slave? For we are also of the Roman people?" </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page57">[pg 57]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "The Roman people, and thou, as one of them, and I, Paullus Cæcilius, are slaves
                    one and all; abject and base and spirit-fallen slaves, lacking the courage even
                    to spurn against our fetters, to the proud tyrannous rich aristocracy." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "By the Gods! we are of it." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "But not the less, for that, slaves to it!" answered Cataline! <span class="tei tei-corr">"See!</span> from the lowest to the highest, each petty pelting officer
                    lords it above the next below him; and if the tribunes for a while, at rare and
                    singular moments, uplift a warning cry against the corrupt insolence of the
                    patrician houses, gold buys them back into vile treasonable silence! Patricians
                    be we, and not slaves, sayest thou? Come tell me then, did the patrician blood
                    of the grand Gracchi preserve them from a shameful doom, because they dared to
                    speak, as free-born men, aloud and freely? Did his patrician blood save Fulvius
                    Flaccus? Were Publius Antonius, and Cornelius Sylla, the less ejected from their
                    offices, that they were of the highest blood in Rome; the lawful consuls by the
                    suffrage of the people? Was I, the heir of Sergius Silo's glory, the less
                    forbidden even to canvass for the consulship, that my great grandsire's blood
                    was poured out, like water, upon those fields that witnessed Rome's extremest
                    peril, Trebia, and the Ticinus, and Thrasymene and Cannæ? Was Lentulus, the
                    noblest of the noble, patrician of the eldest houses, a consular himself,
                    expelled the less and stricken from the rolls of the degenerate senate, for the
                    mere whining of a mawkish wench, because his name is Cornelius? Tush, Tush!
                    these be but dreams of poets, or imaginings of children!—the commons be but
                    slaves to the nobles; the nobles to the senate; the senate to their creditors,
                    their purchasers, their consuls; the last at once their tools, and their
                    tyrants! Go, young man, go. Salute, cringe, fawn upon your consul! Nathless, for
                    thou hast mind enough to mark and note the truth of what I tell thee; thou wilt
                    think upon this, and perchance one day, when the time shall have come, wilt
                    speak, act, strike, for freedom!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And as he finished speaking, he turned aside with a haughty gesture of farewell;
                    and wrapping his toga closely about his tall person, stalked away slowly in the
                    direction neither of the capitol nor of the consul's house; turn<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page58">[pg 58]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ing his head neither to the right hand nor to the
                    left; and taking no more notice of the person to whom he had been speaking, than
                    if he had not known him to be there, and gazing toward him half-bewildered in
                    anxiety and wonder! </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Wonderful! by the Gods!" he said at last. "Truly he is a wonderful man, and
                    wise withal! I fain would know if all that be true, which they say of him—his
                    bitterness, his impiety, his blood-thirstiness! By Hercules! he speaks well! and
                    it is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">true</span></span> likewise. Yea! true it is, that we,
                    patricians, and free, as we style ourselves, may not speak any thing, or act,
                    against our order; no! nor indulge our private pleasures, for fear of the proud
                    censors! Is this, then, freedom? True, we are lords abroad; our fleets, our
                    hosts, everywhere victorious; and not one land, wherein the eagle has unfurled
                    her pinion, but bows before the majesty of Rome—but yet—is it, is it, indeed,
                    true, that we are but slaves, sovereign slaves, at home?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The whole tenor of the young man's thoughts was altered by the few words, let
                    fall for that very purpose by the arch traitor. Ever espying whom he might
                    attach to his party by operating on his passions, his prejudices, his weakness,
                    or his pride; a most sagacious judge of human nature, reading the character of
                    every man as it were in a written book, Cataline had long before remarked young
                    Arvina. He had noted several points of his mental constitution, which he
                    considered liable to receive such impressions as he would—his proneness to
                    defer to the thoughts of others, his want of energetic resolution, and not least
                    his generous indignation against every thing that savored of cruelty or
                    oppression. He had resolved to operate on these, whenever he might find
                    occasion; and should he meet success in his first efforts, to stimulate his
                    passions, minister to his voluptuous pleasures, corrupt his heart, and make him
                    in the end, body and soul, his own. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Such were the intentions of the conspirator, when he first addressed Paullus.
                    His desire to increase the strength of his party, to whom the accession of any
                    member however humble of the great house of Cæcilii could not fail to be useful,
                    alone prompting him in the first instance. But, when he saw by the young man's
                    startled aspect that he was prepossessed against him, and had listened probably
                    to the damning rumors which were <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page59">[pg 59]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>rife everywhere
                    concerning him, a second motive was added, in his pride of seduction and
                    sophistry, by which he was wont to boast, that he could bewilder the strongest
                    minds, and work them to his will. When by the accidental disarrangement of
                    Arvina's gown, and the discovery of his own dagger, he perceived that the
                    intended victim of his specious arts was probably cognizant in some degree of
                    his last night's crime, a third and stronger cause was added, in the instinct of
                    self-preservation. And as soon as he found out that Paullus was bound for the
                    house of Cicero, he considered his life, in some sort, staked upon the issue of
                    his attempt on Arvina's principles. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> No part could have been played with more skill, or with greater knowledge of his
                    character whom he addressed. He said just enough to set him thinking, and to
                    give a bias and a colour to his thoughts, without giving him reason to suspect
                    that he had any interest in the matter; and he had withdrawn himself in that
                    careless and half contemptuous manner, which naturally led the young man to wish
                    for a renewal of the subject. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And in fact Paul, while walking down the hill, toward the house of the Consul,
                    was busied in wondering why Cataline had left so much unsaid, departing so
                    abruptly; and in debating with himself upon the strange doctrines which he had
                    then for the first time heard broached. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was about the second hour of the Roman day, corresponding nearly to eight
                    o'clock before noon—as the winter solstice was now passed—when Arvina reached
                    the magnificent dwelling of the Consul in the Carinæ at the angle of the
                    Cærolian place, hard by the foot of the Sacred Way. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> This splendid building occupied a whole <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">insula</span></span>, as it was
                    called, or space between four streets, intersecting each other at right angles;
                    and was three stories in height, the two upper supported by columns of marble,
                    with a long range of glass windows, at that period an unusual and expensive
                    luxury. The doors stood wide open; and on either hand the vestibule were
                    arranged the lictors leaning upon their fasces, while the whole space of the
                    great Corinthian hall within, lighted from above, and adorned with vast black
                    pillars of Lucullean marble, was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page60">[pg 60]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>crowded with the
                    white robes of the consul's plebeian clients tendering their morning
                    salutations; not unmixed with the crimson fringes and broad crimson facings of
                    senatorial visitors. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Many were there with gifts of all kinds; countrymen from his Sabine farm and his
                    Tusculan retreat, some bringing lambs; some cages full of doves; cheeses, and
                    bowls of fragrant honey; and robes of fine white linen the produce of their
                    daughters' looms; for whom perchance they were seeking dowers at the munificence
                    of their noble patron; artizans of the city, with toys or pieces of furniture,
                    lamps, writing cases, cups or vases of rich workmanship; courtiers with
                    manuscripts rarely illuminated, the work of their most valuable slaves;
                    travellers with gems, and bronzes, offerings known to be esteemed beyond all
                    others by the high-minded lover of the arts, and unrivalled scholar, to whom
                    they were presented. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> These presents, after being duly exhibited to the patron himself, who was seated
                    at the farther end of the hall, concealed from the eyes of Paullus by the
                    intervening crowd, were consigned to the care of the various slaves, or
                    freedmen, who stood round their master, and borne away according to their
                    nature, to the storerooms and offices, or to the library and gallery of the
                    consul; while kind words and a courteous greeting, and a consideration most
                    ample and attentive even of the smallest matters brought before him, awaited all
                    who approached the orator; whether he came empty handed, or full of gifts, to
                    require an audience. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> After a little while, Arvina penetrated far enough through the crowd to command
                    a view of the consul's seat; and for a time he amused himself by watching his
                    movements and manner toward each of his visitors, perhaps not altogether without
                    reference to the conversation he had recently held with Catiline; and certainly
                    not without a desire to observe if the tales he had heard of shameless bribery
                    and corruption, as practiced by many of the great officers of the republic, had
                    any confirmation in the conduct of Cicero. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But he soon saw that the courtesies of that great and virtuous man were
                    regulated neither by the value of the gifts offered, nor by the rank of the
                    visitors; and that his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page61">[pg 61]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>personal predilections even
                    were not allowed to interfere with the division of his time among all worthy of
                    his notice. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Thus he remarked that a young noble, famed for his dissoluteness and evil
                    courses, although he brought an exquisite sculpture of Praxiteles, was received
                    with the most marked and formal coldness, and his gift, which could not be
                    declined, consigned almost without eliciting a glance of approbation, to the
                    hand of a freedman; while, the next moment, as an old white-headed countryman,
                    plainly and almost meanly clad, although with scrupulous cleanliness, approached
                    his presence, the consul rose to meet him; and advancing a step or two took him
                    affectionately by the hand, and asked after his family by name, and listened
                    with profound consideration to the garrulous narrative of the good farmer, who,
                    involved in some petty litigation, had come to seek the advice of his patron;
                    until he sent him away happy and satisfied with the promise of his protection. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> By and by his own turn arrived; and, although he was personally unknown to the
                    orator, and the assistance of the nomenclator, who stood behind the curule
                    chair, was required before he was addressed by name, he was received with the
                    utmost attention; the noble house to which the young man belonged being as
                    famous for its devotion to the common weal, as for the ability and virtue of its
                    sons. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> After a few words of ordinary compliment, Paullus proceeded to intimate to his
                    attentive hearer that his object in waiting at his levee that morning was to
                    communicate momentous information. The thoughtful eye of the great orator
                    brightened, and a keen animated expression came over the features, which had
                    before worn an air almost of lassitude; and he asked eagerly— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Momentous to the Republic—to Rome, my good friend?"—for all his mind was bent
                    on discovering the plots, which he suspected even now to be in process against
                    the state. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Momentous to yourself, Consul," answered Arvina. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Then will it wait," returned the other, with a slight look of disappointment,
                    "and I will pray you to remain, until I have spoken with all my friends here. It
                    will not <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page62">[pg 62]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>be very long, for I have seen nearly all the
                    known faces. If you are, in the mean time, addicted to the humane arts, Davus
                    here will conduct you to my library, where you shall find food for the mind; or
                    if you have not breakfasted, my Syrian will shew you where some of my youthful
                    friends are even now partaking a slight meal." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Accepting the first offer, partly perhaps from a sort of pardonable hypocrisy,
                    desiring to make a favourable impression on the great man, with whom he had for
                    the first time spoken, Arvina followed the intelligent and civil freedman to the
                    library, which was indeed the favourite apartment of the studious magistrate.
                    And, if he half repented, as he went by the chamber wherein several youths of
                    patrician birth, one or two of whom nodded to him as he passed, were assembled,
                    conversing merrily and jesting around a well spread board, he ceased immediately
                    to regret the choice he had made, when the door was thrown open, and he was
                    ushered into the shrine of Cicero's literary leisure. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The library was a small square apartment; for it must be remembered that books
                    at this time being multiplied by manual labor only, and the art being
                    comparatively rare and very costly, the vast collections of modern times were
                    utterly beyond the reach of individuals; and a few scores of volumes were more
                    esteemed than would be as many thousands now, in these days of multiplying
                    presses and steam power. But although inconsiderable in size, not being above
                    sixteen feet square, the decorations of the apartment were not to be surpassed
                    or indeed equalled by anything of modern splendor; for the walls,<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> divided into compartments by
                    mouldings, exquisitely carved and overlaid with burnished gilding, were set with
                    panels of thick plate glass glowing in all the richest hues of purple, ruby,
                    emerald, and azure, through several squares of which the light stole in,
                    gorgeously tinted, from the peristyle, there being no distinction except in this
                    between the windows and the other compartments of the wainscot, if it <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page63">[pg 63]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>may be so styled; and of the ceiling, which was
                    finished in like manner with slabs of stained glass, between the intersecting
                    beams of gilded scroll work. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The floor was of beautiful mosaic, partially covered by a foot-cloth woven from
                    the finest wool, and dyed purple with the juice of the cuttle-fish; and all the
                    furniture corresponded, both in taste and magnificence, to the other decorations
                    of the room. A circular table of cedar wood, inlaid with ivory and brass, so
                    that its value could not have fallen far short of ten thousand sesterces<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a>, stood in the
                    centre of the floor-cloth; with a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bisellium</span></span>, or double
                    settle, wrought in bronze, and two beautiful chairs of the same material not
                    much dissimilar in form to those now used. And, to conclude, a bookcase of
                    polished maple wood, one of the doors of which stood open, displayed a rare
                    collection of about three hundred volumes, each in its circular case of purple
                    parchment, having the name inscribed in letters of gold, silver, or vermilion. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A noble bust in bronze of the Phidian Jupiter, with the sublime expanse of brow,
                    the ambrosian curls and the beard loosely waving, as when he shook Olympus by
                    his nod, and the earth trembled and the depth of Tartarus, stood on a marble
                    pedestal facing the bookcase; and on the table, beside writing materials, leaves
                    of parchment, an ornamental letter-case, a double inkstand and several reed
                    pens, were scattered many gems and trinkets; signets and rings engraved in a
                    style far surpassing any effort of the modern graver, vases of onyx and cut
                    glass, and above all, the statue of a beautiful boy, holding a lamp of bronze
                    suspended by a chain from his left hand, and in his right the needle used to
                    refresh the wick. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Nurtured as he had been from his youth upward among the magnates of the land,
                    accustomed to magnificence and luxury till he had almost fancied that the world
                    had nothing left of beautiful or new that he had not witnessed, Paul stood
                    awhile, after the freedman had departed, gazing with mute admiration on the
                    richness and taste displayed in all the details of this the scholar's sanctum.
                    The very atmosphere of the chamber, filled with the perfume of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page64">[pg 64]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>cedar wood employed as a specific against the ravages
                    of the moth and bookworm, seemed to the young man redolent of midnight learning;
                    and the superb front of the presiding god, calm in the grandeur of its ineffable
                    benignity, who appeared to his excited fancy to smile serene protection on the
                    pursuits of the blameless consul, inspired him with a sense of awful veneration,
                    that did not easily or quickly pass away. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> For some moments, as he gradually recovered the elasticity of his spirits, he
                    amused himself by examining the exquisitely wrought gems on the table; but after
                    a little while, when Cicero came not, he crossed the room quietly to the
                    bookshelves, and selecting a volume of Homer, drew it forth from its richly
                    embossed case, and seating himself on the bronze settle with his back toward the
                    door, had soon forgotten where he was, and the grave business which brought him
                    thither, in the sublime simplicity of the blind rhapsodist. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> An hour or more elapsed thus; yet Paul took no note of time, nor moved at all
                    except to unroll with his right hand the lower margin of the parchment as he
                    read, while with the left he rolled up the top; so that nearly the same space of
                    the manuscript remained constantly before his eyes, although the reader was
                    continually advancing in the poem. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> At length the door opened noiselessly, and with a silent foot, shod in the light
                    slippers which the Romans always wore when in the house, Cicero entered the
                    apartment. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The consul was at this time in the very prime of intellectual manhood, it having
                    been decreed<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a> about a
                    century before, that no person should be elected to that highest office of the
                    state, who should not have attained his forty-third year. He was a tall and
                    elegantly formed man, with nothing especially worthy of remark in his figure, if
                    it were not that his neck was unusually long and slender, though not so much so
                    as to constitute any drawback to his personal appearance, which, without being
                    what would exactly be termed handsome, was both elegant and graceful. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page65">[pg 65]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>His features were not, indeed, very bold or striking;
                    but intellect was strongly and singularly marked in every line of the face; and
                    the expression,—calm, thoughtful, and serene,—though it had not the quick and
                    restless play of ever-varying lights and shadows which belongs to the quicker
                    and more imaginative temperaments among men of the highest genius,—could not
                    fail to impress any one with the conviction, that the mind which informed it
                    must be of eminent capacity, and depth, and power. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He entered, as I have said, silently; and although there was nothing of
                    stealthiness in his gait, which being very light and slow was yet both firm and
                    springy, nor any of that cunning in his manner which is so often coupled to a
                    prowling footstep, he yet advanced so noiselessly over the soft floor-cloth,
                    that he stood at Arvina's elbow, and overlooked the page in which he was
                    reading, before the young man was aware of his vicinity. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ha!" he exclaimed, after standing a moment, and observing with a soft pleasant
                    smile the abstraction of his visitor, "so thou readest Greek, and art thyself a
                    poet." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "A little of the first, my consul," replied Arvina, arising quickly to his feet,
                    with the ingenuous blood rushing to his brow at the detection. "But wherefore
                    shouldst thou believe me the second?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "We statesmen," answered the consul, "are wont to study other men's characters,
                    as other men are wont to study books; and I have learned by practice to draw
                    quick conclusions from small signs. But in this instance, the light in your eye,
                    the curl of your expanded nostril, the half frown on your brow, and the flush on
                    your cheek, told me beyond a doubt that you are a poet. And you are so, young
                    man. I care not whether you have penned as yet an elegy, or no—nevertheless,
                    you are in soul, in temperament, in fantasy, a poet. Do you love Homer?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Beyond all other writers I have ever met, in my small course of reading. There
                    is a majesty, a truth, an ever-burning fire, lustrous, yet natural and most
                    beneficent, like the sun's glory on a summer day, in his immortal words, that
                    kindles and irradiates, yet consumes not the soul; a grand simplicity, that
                    never strains for effect; a sweet pathos, that elicits tears without evoking
                    them; a melody that flows on, like the harmony of the eternal sea, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page66">[pg 66]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>or, if we may call fancy to our aid, the music of the
                    spheres, telling us that like these the blind bard sang, because song was his
                    nature—was within, and must out—not bound by laws, or measured by pedantic
                    rules, but free, unfettered, and spontaneous as the billows, which in its wild
                    and many-cadenced sweep it most resembles." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ah! said I not," replied Cicero, "that you were a poet? And you have been
                    discoursing me most eloquent poetry; though not attuned to metre, <span class="tei tei-sic">rythmical</span>
                    withal, and full of fancy. Ay! and you judge aright. He is the greatest, as the
                    first of poets; and surpassed all his followers as much in the knowledge of the
                    human heart with its ten thousands of conflicting passions, as in the structure
                    of the kingly verse, wherein he delineated character as never man did, saving
                    only he. But hold, Arvina. Though I could willingly spend hours with thee in
                    converse on this topic, the state has calls on me, which must be obeyed. Tell
                    me, therefore, I pray you, as shortly as may be, what is the matter you would
                    have me know. Shortly, I pray you, for my time is short, and my duties onerous
                    and manifold." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Laying aside the roll, which he had still held open during that brief
                    conversation, and laying aside with it his enthusiastic and passionate manner,
                    the young man now stated, simply and briefly, the events of the past night, the
                    discovery of the murdered slave, and the accident by which he had learned that
                    he was the consul's property; and in conclusion, laid the magnificently
                    ornamented dagger which he had found, on the board before Cicero; observing,
                    that the weapon might give a clue to poor Medon's death. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Cicero was moved deeply—moved, not simply, as Arvina fancied, by sorrow for the
                    dead, but by something approaching nearly to remorse. He started up from the
                    chair, which he had taken when the youth began his tale, and clasping his hands
                    together violently, strode rapidly to and fro the small apartment. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Alas, and wo is me, poor Medon! Faithful wert thou, and true, and very pleasant
                    to mine eyes! Alas! that thou art gone, and gone too so wretchedly! And wo is
                    me, that I listened not to my own apprehensions, rather than to thy trusty
                    boldness. Alas! that I suffered thee to<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page67">[pg 67]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> go, for they
                    have murdered thee! ay, thine own zeal betrayed thee; but by the Gods that
                    govern in Olympus, they shall rue it!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> After this burst of passion he became more cool, and, resuming his seat, asked
                    Paullus a few shrewd and pertinent questions concerning the nature of the ground
                    whereon he had found the corpse, the traces left by the mortal struggle, the
                    hour at which the discovery was made, and many other minute points of the same
                    nature; the answers to which he noted carefully on his waxed tablets. When he
                    had made all the inquiries that occurred to him, he read aloud the answers as he
                    had set them down, and asked if he would be willing at any moment to attest the
                    truth of those things. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "At any moment, and most willingly, my consul," the youth replied. "I would do
                    much myself to find out the murderers and bring them to justice, were it only
                    for my poor freedman Thrasea's sake, who is his cousin-german." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Fear not, young man, they <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">shall</span></span> be brought to justice,"
                    answered Cicero. "In the meantime do thou keep silence, nor say one word
                    touching this to any one that lives. Carry the dagger with thee; wear it as
                    ostentatiously as may be—perchance it shall turn out that some one may claim or
                    recognise it. Whatever happeneth, let me know privately. Thus far hast thou done
                    well, and very wisely: go on as thou hast commenced, and, hap what hap, count
                    Cicero thy friend. But above all, doubt not—I say, doubt not one moment,—that
                    as there is One eye that seeth all things in all places, that slumbereth not by
                    day nor sleepeth in the watches of night, that never waxeth weak at any time or
                    weary—as there is One hand against which no panoply can arm the guilty, from
                    which no distance can protect, nor space of time secure him, so surely shall
                    they perish miserable who did this miserable murder, and their souls rue it
                    everlastingly beyond the portals of the grave, which are but the portals of
                    eternal life, and admit all men to wo or bliss, for ever and for ever!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He spoke solemnly and sadly; and on his earnest face there was a deep and almost
                    awful expression, that held Arvina mute and abashed, he knew not wherefore; and
                    when the great man had ceased from speaking, he made a silent gesture of
                    salutation and withdrew, thus gravely <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page68">[pg 68]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>warned, scarce
                    conscious if the statesman noted his departure; for he had fallen into a deep
                    reverie, and was perhaps musing on the mysteries yet unrevealed of the immortal
                    soul, so totally careless did he now appear of all sublunary matters. </p>

                    so early, and with so grave a face?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Arvina started; for so deep was the impression made on his mind by the last
                    words of Cicero, that he had passed out into the Sacred Way, and walked some
                    distance down it, toward the Forum, in deep meditation, from which he was
                    aroused by the clear accents of the merry speaker. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Looking up with a smile as he recognised the voice, he saw two young men of
                    senatorial rank—for both wore the crimson laticlave on the breast of their
                    tunics—on horseback, followed by several slaves on foot, who had overtaken him
                    unnoticed amid the din and bustle which had drowned the clang of their horses'
                    feet on the pavement. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Nay, I scarce know, Aurelius!" replied the young man, laughing; "I thought I
                    was going home, but it seems that my back is turned to my own house, and I am
                    going toward the market-place, although the Gods know that I have no business
                    with the brawling lawyers, with whom it is alive by this time." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Come with us, then," replied the other; "<span class="tei tei-corr">Aristius,</span>
                    here, and I, have made a bet upon our coursers' speed. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page70">[pg 70]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>He fancies his Numidian can outrun my Gallic beauty. Come with us to the

                    or a swim in the Tiber, until it shall be time to go to dinner." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "How can I go with you, seeing that you are well mounted, and I afoot, and
                    encumbered with my gown? You must consider me a second Achilles to keep up with
                    your fleet coursers, clad in this heavy toga, which is a worse garb for running
                    than any panoply that Vulcan ever wrought." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "We will alight," cried the other youth, who had not yet spoken, "and give our
                    horses to the boys to lead behind us; or, hark you, why not send Geta back to
                    your house, and let your slaves bring down your horse too? If they make
                    tolerable speed, coming down by the back of the Cœlian, and thence beside the

                    may overtake us easily before we reach the Campus. Aurelius has some errand to
                    perform near the Forum, which will detain us a few moments longer. What say
                    you?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "He will come, he will come, certainly," cried the other, springing down lightly
                    from the back of his beautiful courser, which indeed merited the eulogium, as
                    well as the caresses which he now lavished on it, patting his favorite's
                    high-arched neck, and stroking the soft velvet muzzle, which was thrust into his
                    hand, with a low whinnying neigh of recognition, as he stood on the raised foot
                    path, holding the embroidered rein carelessly in his hand. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I will," said Arvina, "gladly; I have nothing to hinder me this morning; and
                    for some days past I have been detained with business, so that I have not
                    visited the campus, or backed a horse, or cast a javelin—by Hercules! not since
                    the Ides, I fancy. You will all beat me in the field, that is certain, and in
                    the river likewise. But come, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page71">[pg 71]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Fuscus Aristius, if it
                    is to be as you have planned it, jump down from your Numidian, and let your Geta
                    ride him up the hill to my house. I would have asked Aurelius, but he will let
                    no slave back his white <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Notus</span></span>." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Not I, by the twin horsemen! nor any free man either—plebeian, knight, or
                    noble. Since first I bought him of the blue-eyed Celt, who wept in his barbarian
                    fondness for the colt, no leg save only mine has crossed his back, nor ever
                    shall, while the light of day smiles on Aurelius Victor." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Without a word Fuscus leaped from the back of the fine blood-bay barb he
                    bestrode, and beckoning to a confidential slave who followed him, "Here," he
                    said, "Geta, take Nanthus, and ride straightway up the Minervium to the house of
                    Arvina; thou knowest it, beside the Alban Mansions, and do as he shall command
                    you. Tell him, my Paullus." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Carry this signet, my good Geta," said the young man, drawing off the large
                    seal-ring which adorned his right hand, and giving it to him, "to Thrasea, my
                    trusty freedman, and let him see that they put the housings and gallic wolf-bit
                    on the black horse Aufidus, and bring him thou, with one of my slaves, down the
                    slope of Scaurus, and past the Great Circus, to the Carmental Gate, where thou
                    wilt find us. Make good speed, Geta." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ay, do so," interposed his master, "but see that thou dost not blow Nanthus;
                    thou wert better be a dead slave, Geta, than let me find one drop of sweat on
                    his flank. Nay! never grin, thou hang-dog, or I will have thee given to my
                        Congers<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a>; the last which came out of the fish pond were
                    but ill fed; and a fat German, such as thou, would be a rare meal for them." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The slave laughed, knowing well that his master was but jesting, mounted the
                    horse, and rode him at a gentle trot, up the slope of the Cælian hill, from
                    which Arvina had but a little while before descended. In the mean time, Aristius
                    gave the rein of his dappled grey to one of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page72">[pg 72]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his
                    followers, desiring him to be very gentle with him, and the three young men
                    sauntered slowly on along the Sacred Way toward the Forum, conversing merrily
                    and interchanging many a smile and salutation with those whom they met on their
                    road. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Skirting the base of the Palatine hill, they passed the old circular temple of
                    Remus to the right hand, and the most venerable relic of Rome's infancy, the
                    Ruminal Fig tree, beneath which the she-wolf was believed to have given suck to
                    the twin progeny of Mars and the hapless Ilia. A little farther on, the mouth of
                    the sacred grotto called Lupercal, surrounded with its shadowy grove, the
                    favourite haunt of Pan, lay to their left; and fronting them, the splendid arch
                    of Fabius, surnamed Allobrox for his victorious prowess against that savage
                    tribe, gave entrance to the great Roman Forum. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Immediately at their left hand as they entered the archway, was the superb
                    Comitium, wherein the Senate were wont to give audience to foreign embassies of
                    suppliant nations, with the gigantic portico, three columns of which may still
                    be seen to testify to the splendor of the old city, in the far days of the
                    republic. Facing them were the steps of the Asylum, with the Mamertine prison
                    and the grand façade of the temple of Concord to the right and left; and higher
                    above these the portico of the gallery of records, and higher yet the temple of
                    the thundering Jupiter, and glittering above all, against the dark blue sky, the
                    golden dome, and white marble columns of the great capitol itself. Around in all
                    directions were basilicæ, or halls of justice; porticoes filled with busy
                    lawyers; bankers' shops glittering with their splendid wares, and bedecked with
                    the golden shields taken from the Samnites; statues of the renowned of ages,
                    Accius Nævius, who cut the whetstone with the razor; Horatius Cocles on his
                    thunderstricken pedestal, halting on one knee from the wound which had not
                    hindered him from swimming the swollen Tiber; Clælia the hostage on her brazen
                    steed; and many another, handed down inviolate from the days of the ancient
                    kings. Here was the rostrum, beaked with the prows of ships, a fluent orator
                    already haranguing the assembled people from its platform—there, the seat of
                    the city Prætor, better known as the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Puteal Libonis</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page73">[pg 73]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>with that officer in session on his curule chair, his
                    six lictors leaning on their fasces at his back, as he promulgated his
                    irrevocable edicts. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was a grand sight, surely, and one to gaze on which men of the present day
                    would do and suffer much; and judge themselves most happy if blessed with one
                    momentary glance of the heart, as it were, of the old world's mistress. But
                    these young men, proud as they were, and boastful of the glories of their native
                    Rome, had looked too often on that busy scene to be attracted by the
                    gorgeousness of the place, crowded with buildings, the like of which the modern
                    world knows not, and thronged with nations of every region of the earth, each in
                    his proper dress, each seeking justice, pleasure, profit, fame, as it pleased
                    him, free, and fearless, and secure of property and person. Casting a brief
                    glance over it, they turned short to the left, by a branch of the Sacred Way,
                    which led, skirting the market place, between the Comitium, or hall of the
                    ambassadors, and the abrupt declivity of the Palatine, past the end of the
                    Atrium of Liberty, and the cattle mart, toward the Carmental gate. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Methought you said, my Fuscus, that our Aurelius had some errand to perform in
                    the Forum; how is this, is it a secret?" inquired Paullus, laughing. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No secret, by the Gods!" said Aurelius, "it is but to buy a pair of spurs in
                    Volero's shop, hard by Vesta's shrine." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "He will need them," cried Fuscus, "he will need them, I will swear, in the
                    race." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Not to beat Nanthus," said Aurelius; "but oh! Jove! walk quickly, I beseech
                    you; how hot a steam of cooked meats and sodden cabbage, reeks from the door of
                    yon cook-shop. Now, by the Gods! it well nigh sickened me! Ha! Volero," he
                    exclaimed, as they reached the door of a booth, or little shop, with neat
                    leathern curtains festooned up in front, glittering with polished cutlery and
                    wares of steel and silver, to a middle aged man, who was busy burnishing a knife
                    within, "what ho! my Volero, some spurs—I want some spurs; show me some of your
                    sharpest and brightest." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I have a pair, noble Aurelius, which I got only yesterday in trade with a
                    turbaned Moor from the deserts <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page74">[pg 74]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>beyond Cyrenaica. By
                    Mulciber, my patron god! the fairest pair my eyes ever looked upon. Right loath
                    was the swart barbarian to let me have them, but hunger, hunger is a great tamer
                    of your savage; and the steam of good Furbo's cook-shop yonder was suggestive of
                    savory chops and greasy sausages—and—and—in short, Aurelius, I got them at a
                    bargain." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> While he was speaking, he produced the articles in question, from a strong
                    brass-bound chest, and rubbing them on his leather apron held them up for the
                    inspection of the youthful noble. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Truly," cried Victor, catching them out of his hand, "truly, they are good
                    spurs." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Good spurs! good spurs!" cried the merchant, half indignantly, "I call them
                    splendid, glorious, inimitable! Only look you here, it is all virgin silver; and
                    observe, I beseech you, this dragon's neck and the sibilant head that holds the
                    rowels; they are wrought to the very life with horrent scales, and erected
                    crest; beautiful! beautiful!—and the rowels too of the best Spanish steel that
                    was ever tempered in the cold Bilbilis. Good spurs indeed! they are well worth
                    three <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">aurei</span></span>.<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a> But I will keep them, as I meant
                    to do at first, for Caius Cæsar; he will know what they are worth, and give it
                    too." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Didst ever hear so pestilent a knave?" said Victor, laughing; "one would
                    suppose I had disparaged the accursed things! But, as I said before, they are
                    good spurs, and I will have them; but I will not give thee three aurei, master
                    Volero; two is enough, in all conscience; or sixty denarii at the most. Ho!
                    Davus, Davus! bring my purse, hither, Davus," he called to his slaves without;
                    and, as the purse-bearer entered, he continued without waiting for an answer,
                    "Give Volero two aurei, and ten denarii, and take these spurs." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No! no!" exclaimed Volero, "you shall not—no! by the Gods! they cost me more
                    than that!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ye Gods! what a lie! cost thee—and to a barbarian! I dare be sworn thou didst
                    not pay him the ten denarii alone." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
                    <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page75">[pg 75]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>"By Hercules! I did, though," said the other, "and
                    thou shouldst not have them for three <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">aurei</span></span> either, but
                    that it is drawing near the Calends of November, and I have moneys to pay then." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Sixty-five I will give thee—sixty-five denarii!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Give me my spurs; what, art thou turning miser in thy youth, Aurelius?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "There, give him the gold, Davus; he is a regular usurer. Give him three <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">aurei</span></span>, and then buckle these to my heel. Ha! that is
                    well, my Paullus, here come your fellows with black Aufidus, and our friend Geta
                    on the Numidian. They have made haste, yet not sweated Nanthus either. Aristius,
                    your groom is a good one; I never saw a horse that shewed his keeping or
                    condition better. Now then, Arvina, doff your toga, you will not surely ride in
                    that." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Indeed I will not," replied Paullus, "if master Volero will suffer me to leave
                    it here till my return." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Willingly, willingly; but what is this?" exclaimed the cutler, as Arvina
                    unbuckling his toga and suffering it to drop on the ground, stood clad in his
                    succinct and snow-white tunic only, girded about him with a zone of purple
                    leather, in which was stuck the sheathless dirk of Cataline. "What is this,
                    noble Paullus? that you carry at your belt, with no scabbard? If you go armed,
                    you should at least go safely. See, if you were to bend your body somewhat
                    quickly, it might well be that the keen point would rend your groin. Give it me,
                    I can fit it with a sheath in a moment." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I do not know but it were as well to do so," answered Paullus, extricating the
                    dagger from his belt, "if you will not detain us a long time." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Not even a short time!" said the cutler, "give it to me, I can fit it
                    immediately." And he stretched out his hand and took it; but hardly had his eye
                    dwelt on it, for a moment, when he cried, "but this is not yours—this is—where
                    got you this, Arvina?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Nay, it is nought to thee; perhaps I bought it, perhaps it was given to me; do
                    thou only fit it with a scabbard." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Buy it thou didst not, Paullus, I'll be sworn; and I <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page76">[pg 76]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                    think it was never given thee; and, see, see here, what is this I—there has
                    been blood on the blade!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Folly!" exclaimed the young man, turning first very red and then pale, so that
                    his comrades gazed on him with wonder, "folly, I say. It is not blood, but
                    water that has dimmed its shine;—and how knowest thou that I did not buy it?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "How do I know it?—thus," answered the artizan, drawing from a cupboard under
                    his counter, a weapon precisely the facsimile in every respect of that in his
                    hand: "There never were but two of these made, and I made them; the scabbard of
                    this will fit that; see how the very chased work <span class="tei tei-corr">fits!</span> I sold this, but not to
                    you, Arvina; and I do not believe that it was given to you." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Filth that thou art, and carrion!" exclaimed the young man fiercely, striking
                    his hand with violence upon the counter, "darest thou brave a nobleman? I tell
                    thee, I doubt not at all that there be twenty such in every cutler's shop in
                    Rome!—but to whom did'st thou sell this, that thou art so certain?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Paullus Cæcilius," replied the mechanic gravely but respectfully, "I brave no
                    man, least of all a patrician; but mark my words—I did sell this dagger; here
                    is my own mark on its back; if it was given to thee, thou must needs know the
                    giver; for the rest, this <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></span> blood that has dimmed it,
                    and not water; you cannot deceive me in the matter; and I would warn you,
                    youth,—noble as you are, and plebeian I,—that there are laws in Rome, one of
                    them called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Cornelia de Sicariis</span></span>, which you were best take
                    care that you know not more nearly. Meantime, you can take this scabbard if you
                    will," handing to him, as he spoke, the sheath of the second weapon; "the price
                    is one sestertium; it is the finest silver, chased as you see, and overlaid with
                    pure gold." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Thou hast the money," returned Paullus, casting down on the counter several
                    golden coins, stamped with a helmed head of Mars, and an eagle on the reverse,
                    grasping a thunderbolt in its talons—"and the sheath is mine. Then thou wilt
                    not disclose to whom it was sold?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Why should I, since thou knowest without telling?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Wilt thou, or not?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Not to thee, Paullus." </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page77">[pg 77]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Then will I find some one, to whom thou wilt fain disclose it!" he answered
                    haughtily. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And who may that be, I beseech you?" asked the mechanic, half sneeringly. "For
                    my part, I fancy you will let it rest altogether; some one was hurt with it last
                    night, as you and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">he</span></span>, we both know, can tell if you will!
                    But I knew not that you were one of his men." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> There was an insolent sneer on the cutler's face that galled the young nobleman
                    to the quick; and what was yet more annoying, there was an assumption of mutual
                    intelligence and equality about him, that almost goaded the patrician's blood to
                    fury. But by a mighty effort he subdued his passion to his will; and snatching
                    up the weapon returned it to his belt, left the shop, and springing to the
                    saddle of his beautiful black horse, rode furiously away. It was not till he
                    reached the Carmental Gate, giving egress from the city through the vast walls
                    of Cyclopean architecture, immediately at the base of the dread Tarpeian rock,
                    overlooked and commanded by the outworks and turrets of the capitol, that he
                    drew in his eager horse, and looked behind him for his friends. But they were
                    not in sight; and a moment's reflection told him that, being about to start
                    their coursers on a trial of speed, they would doubtless ride gently over the
                    rugged pavement of the crowded streets. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He doubted for a minute, whether he should turn back to meet them, or wait for
                    their arrival at the gate, by which they must pass to gain the campus; but the
                    fear of missing them, instantly induced him to adopt the latter course, and he
                    sat for a little space motionless on his well-bitted and obedient horse beneath
                    the shadow of the deep gate-way. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Here his eye wandered around him for awhile, taking note indeed of the
                    surrounding objects, the great temple of Jupiter Stator on the Palatine; the
                    splendid portico of Catulus, adorned with the uncouth and grisly spoils of the
                    Cimbric hordes slaughtered on the plains of Vercellæ; the house of Scaurus,
                    toward which a slow wain tugged by twelve powerful oxen was even then dragging
                    one of the pondrous columns which rendered his hall for many years the boast of
                    Roman luxury; and on the other tall buildings that stood every where about him;
                    although in truth he scarce observed what for the time his eye dwelt upon. </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page78">[pg 78]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> At length an impatient motion of his horse caused him to turn his face toward
                    the black precipice of the huge rock at whose base he sat, and in a moment it
                    fastened upon his mind with singular vividness—singular, for he had paused
                    fifty times upon that spot before, without experiencing such feelings—that he
                    was on the very pavement, which had so often been bespattered with the blood of
                    despairing traitors. The noble Manlius, tumbled from the very rock, which his
                    single arm had but a little while before defended, seemed to lie there, even at
                    his feet, mortally maimed and in the agony of death, yet even so too proud to
                    mix one groan with the curses he poured forth against Rome's democratic rabble.
                    Then, by a not inapt transition, the scene changed, and Caius Marcius was at
                    hand, with the sword drawn in his right, that won him the proud name of
                    Coriolanus, and the same rabble that had hurled Caius Manlius down, yelling and
                    hooting "to the rock with him! to the rock!" but at a safe and respectful
                    distance; their factious tribunes goading them to outrage and new riot. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was strange that these thoughts should have occurred so clearly at this
                    moment to the excited mind of the young noble; and he felt that it was strange
                    himself; and would have banished the ideas, but they would not away; and he
                    continued musing on the inconstant turbulence of the plebeians, and the unerring
                    doom which had overtaken every one of their idols, from the hands of their own
                    partizans, until his companions at length rode slowly up the street to join him. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> There was some coldness in the manner of Aristius Fuscus, as they met again, and
                    even Aurelius seemed surprised and not well pleased; for they had in truth been
                    conversing earnestly about the perturbation of their friend at the remarks of
                    the artizan, and the singularity of his conduct in wearing arms at all; and he
                    heard Victor say just before they joined company— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No! that is not so odd, Fuscus, in these times. It was but two nights since, as
                    I was coming home something later than my wont from Terentia's, that I fell in
                    with Clodius reeling along, frantically drunk and furious, with half a dozen
                    torch-bearers before, and half a score wolfish looking gladiators all armed with
                    blade and buck<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page79">[pg 79]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ler, and all half-drunk, behind him. I
                    do assure you that I almost swore I would go out no more without weapons." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "They would have done you no good, man," said Aristius, "if some nineteen or
                    twenty had set upon you. But an they would, I care not; it is against the law,
                    and no good citizen should carry them at all." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Carry arms, I suppose you mean, Aristius," interrupted Paullus boldly. "Ye are
                    talking about me, I fancy—is it not so?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ay, it is," replied the other gravely. "You were disturbed not a little at what
                    stout Volero said." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I was, I was," answered Arvina very quickly, "because I could not tell him; and
                    it is not pleasant to be suspected. The truth is that the dagger is not mine at
                    all, and that it <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></span> blood that was on it; for last
                    night—but lo!" he added, interrupting himself, "I was about to speak out, and
                    tell you all; and yet my lips are sealed." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I am sorry to hear it," said Aristius, "I do not like mysteries; and this seems
                    to me a dark one!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "It is—as dark as Erebus," said Paullus eagerly, "and as guilty too; but it is
                    not my mystery, so help me the god of good faith and honour!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "That is enough said; surely that is enough for you, Aristius," exclaimed the
                    warmer and more excitable Aurelius. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "For you it may be," replied the noble youth, with a melancholy smile. "You are
                    a boy in heart, my Aurelius, and overflow so much with generosity and truth that
                    you believe all others to be as frank and candid. I alas! have grown old
                    untimely, and, having seen what I have seen, hold men's assertions little
                    worth." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The hot blood mounted fiercely into the cheek of Paullus; and, striking his
                    horse's flank suddenly with his heel, he made him passage half across the
                    street, and would have seized Aristius by the throat, had not their comrade
                    interposed to hinder him. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "You are both mad, I believe; so mad that all the hellebore in both the
                    Anticyras could not cure you. Thou, Fuscus, for insulting him with needless
                    doubts. Thou, Paullus, for mentioning the thing, or shewing the dagger at all,
                    if you did not choose to explain." </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page80">[pg 80]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I do <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">choose</span></span> to explain," replied Cæcilius, "but I
                    cannot; I have explained it all to Marcus Tullius." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "To Cicero," exclaimed Aristius. "Why did you not say so before? I was wrong,
                    then, I confess my error; if Cicero be satisfied, it must needs be all well." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "That name of Cicero is like the voice of an oracle to Fuscus ever!" said
                    Aurelius Victor, laughing. "I believe he thinks the new man from Arpinum a very
                    god, descended from Olympus!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No! not a God," replied Aristius Fuscus, "only the greatest work of God, a wise
                    and virtuous man, in an age which has few such to boast. But come, let us ride
                    on and conclude our race; and thou, Arvina, forget what I said; I meant not to
                    wrong thee." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I have forgotten," answered Paullus; and, with the word, they gave their horses
                    head, and cantered onward for the field of Mars. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The way for some distance was narrow, lying between the fortified rock of the
                    Capitol, with its stern lines of immemorial ramparts on the right hand, and on
                    the left the long arcades and stately buildings of the vegetable mart, on the
                    river bank, now filled with sturdy peasants, from the Sabine country, eager to
                    sell their fresh green herbs; and blooming girls, from Tibur and the banks of
                    Anio, with garlands of flowers, and cheeks that outvied their own brightest
                    roses. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Beyond these, still concealing the green expanse of the level plain, and the
                    famous river, stood side by side three temples, sacred to Juno Matuta, Piety,
                    and Hope; each with its massy colonnade of Doric or Corinthian, or Ionic
                    pillars; the latter boasting its frieze wrought in bronze; and that of Piety,
                    its tall equestrian statue, so richly gilt and burnished that it gleamed in the
                    sunlight as if it were of solid gold. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Onward they went, still at a merry canter, their generous and high mettled
                    coursers fretting against the bits which restrained their speed, and their young
                    hearts elated and bounding quickly in their bosoms, with the excitement of the
                    gallant exercise; and now they cleared the last winding of the suburban street,
                    and clothed in its perennial verdure, the wide field lay outspread, like one
                    sheet of emerald verdure, before them, with the bright Tiber flash<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page81">[pg 81]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ing to the sun in many a reach and ripple, and the gay
                    slope of the Collis Hortulorum, glowing with all its terraced gardens in the
                    distance. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A few minutes more brought them to the Flaminian way, whereon, nearly midway the
                    plain, stood the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">diribitorium</span></span>, or pay-office of the
                    troops; the porticoes of which were filled with the soldiers of Metellus
                    Creticus, and Quintus Marcius Rex, who lay with their armies encamped on the low
                    hills beyond the river, waiting their triumphs, and forbidden by the laws to
                    come into the city so long as they remained invested with their military rank.
                    Around this stately building were many colonnades, and open buildings adapted to
                    the exercises of the day, when winter or bad weather should prevent their
                    performance in the open mead, and stored with all appliances, and instruments
                    required for the purpose; and to these Paullus and his friends proceeded,
                    answering merely with a nod or passing jest the salutations of many a helmed
                    centurion and gorgeous tribune of the soldiery. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A grand Ionic gateway gave them admittance to the hippodrome, a vast oval space,
                    adorned with groups of sculpture and obelisks and columns in the midst; on some
                    of which were affixed inscriptions commemorative of great feats of skill or
                    strength or daring; while others displayed placards announcing games or contests
                    to take place in future, and challenges of celebrated gymnasts for the cestus
                    fight, the wrestling match, or the foot-race. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Around the outer circumference were rows of seats, shaded by plane trees overrun
                    with ivy, and there were already seated many young men of noble birth, chatting
                    together, or betting, with their waxed tablets and their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">styli</span></span><a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href="#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a> in their
                    hands, some waiting the commencement of the race between Fuscus and Victor,
                    others watching with interest the progress of a sham fight on horseback between
                    two young men of the equestrian order, denoted by the narrow crimson stripes on
                    their tunics, who were careering to and fro, armed with long staves and circular
                    bucklers, in all the swift and beautiful movements of the mimic combat. </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page82">[pg 82]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Among those most interested in this spectacle, the eye of Arvina fell instantly
                    on the tall and gaunt form of Catiline, who stood erect on one of the marble
                    benches, applauding with his hands, and now and then shouting a word of
                    encouragement to the combatants, as they wheeled by him in the mazes of their
                    half angry sport. It was not long, however, before their strife was brought to a
                    conclusion; for, almost as the friends entered, the hindmost horseman of the two
                    made a thrust at the other, which taking effect merely on the lower rim of his
                    antagonist's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">parma</span></span>, glanced off under his outstretched
                    arm, and made the striker, in a great measure, lose his balance. As quick as
                    light, the other wheeled upon him, feinted a pass at his breast with the point
                    of the staff; and then, as he lowered his shield to guard himself, reversed the
                    weapon with a swift turn of the wrist, dealt him a heavy blow with the trunchon
                    on the head; and then, while the whole place rang with tumultuous plaudits,
                    circled entirely round him to the left, and delivered his thrust with such
                    effect in the side, that it bore his competitor clear out of the saddle. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Euge! Euge! well done," shouted Catiline in ecstacy; "by Hercules! I never saw
                    in all my life better skirmishing. It is all over with Titus Varus!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And in truth it was all over with him; but not in the sense which the speaker
                    meant: for, as he fell, the horses came into collision, and it so happened that
                    the charger of the conqueror, excited by the fury of the contest, laid hold of
                    the other's neck with his teeth, and almost tore away a piece of the muscular
                    flesh at the very moment when the rider's spur, as he fell, cut a long gash in
                    his flank. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> With a wild yelling neigh, the tortured brute yerked out his heels viciously;
                    and, as ill luck would have it, both took effect on the person of his fallen
                    master, one striking him a terrible blow on the chest, the other shattering his
                    collar bone and shoulder. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A dozen of the spectators sprang down from the seats and took him up before
                    Paullus could dismount to aid him; but, as they raised him from the ground, his
                    eyes were already glazing. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Marcius has conquered me," he muttered in tones of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page83">[pg 83]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                    deep mortification, unconscious, as it would seem, of his agony, and wounded
                    only by the indomitable Roman pride; and with the words his jaw dropped, and his
                    last strife was ended. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "The fool!" exclaimed Cataline, with a bitter sneer; "what had he got to do,
                    that he should ride against Caius Marcius, when he could not so much as keep his
                    saddle, the fool!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "He is gone!" cried another; "game to the last, brave Varus!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "He came of a brave race," said a third; "but he rode badly!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "At least not so well as Marcius," replied yet a fourth; "but who does? To be
                    foiled by him does not argue bad riding." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Who does? why Paullus, here," cried Aurelius Victor; "I'll match him, if he
                    will ride, for a thousand sesterces—ten thousand, if you will." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No! I'll not bet about it. I lost by this cursed chance," answered the former
                    speaker; "but Varus did not ride badly, I maintain it!" he added, with the
                    steadiness of a discomfited partisan. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ay! but he did, most pestilently," interposed Catiline, almost fiercely; "but
                    come, come, why don't they carry him away? we are losing all the morning." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I thought he was a friend of yours, Sergius," said another of the bystanders,
                    apparently vexed at the heartlessness of his manner. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Why, ay! so he was," replied the conspirator; "but he is nothing now: nor can
                    my friendship aught avail him. It was his time and his fate! ours, it may be,
                    will come to-morrow. Nor do I see at all wherefore our sports should not
                    proceed, because a man has gone hence. Fifty men every day die somewhere, while
                    we are dining, drinking, kissing our mistresses or wives; but do we stop for
                    that? Ho! bear him hence, we will attend his funeral, when it shall be soever;
                    and we will drink to his memory to-day. What comes next, comrades?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Arvina, it is true, was for a moment both shocked and disgusted at the heartless
                    and unfeeling tone; but few if any of the others evinced the like tenderness;
                    for it must be remembered, in the first place, that the Romans, inured <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page84">[pg 84]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to sights of blood and torture daily in the
                    gladiatorial fights of the arena, were callous to human suffering, and careless
                    of human life at all times; and, in the second, that Stoicism was the
                    predominant affectation of the day, not only among the rude and coarse, but
                    among the best and most virtuous citizens of the republic. Few, therefore, left
                    the ground, when the corpse, decently enveloped in the toga he had worn when
                    living, was borne homewards; except the involuntary homicide, who could not even
                    at that day in decency remain, and a few of his most intimate associates, who
                    covering their faces in the lappets of their gowns, followed the bearers in
                    stern and silent sorrow. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Scarcely then had the sad procession threaded the marble archway, before
                    Catiline again asked loudly and imperiously, </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "What is to be the next, I pray you? are we to sit here like old women by their
                    firesides, croaking and whimpering till dinner time?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No! by the gods," cried Aurelius, "we have a race to come off, which I propose
                    to win. Fuscus Aristius here, and I—we will start instantly, if no one else has
                    the ground." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Away with you then," answered the other; "come sit by me, Arvina, I would say a
                    word with you." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Giving his horse to one of his grooms, the young man followed him without
                    answer; for although it is true that Catiline was at this time a marked man and
                    of no favorable reputation, yet squeamishness in the choice of associates was
                    never a characteristic of the Romans; and persons, the known perpetrators of the
                    most atrocious crimes, so long as they were unconvicted, mingled on terms of
                    equality, unshunned by any, except the gravest and most rigid censors. Arvina,
                    too, was very young; and very young men are often fascinated, as it were, by
                    great reputations, even of great criminals, with a passionate desire to see them
                    more closely, and observe the stuff they are made of. So that, in fact, Catiline
                    being looked upon in those days much as a desperate gambler, a celebrated
                    duellist, or a famous seducer of our own time, whom no one shuns though every
                    one abuses, it was not perhaps very wonderful if this rash, ardent, and
                    inexperienced youth should have conceived himself flattered by such <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page85">[pg 85]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> notice, from one of whom all the world was talking;
                    and should have followed him to a seat with a sense of gratified vanity, blended
                    with eager curiosity. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The race, which followed, differed not much from any other race; except that the
                    riders having no stirrups, that being a yet undiscovered luxury, much less
                    depended upon jockeyship—the skill of the riders being limited to keeping their
                    seats steadily and guiding the animals they bestrode—and much more upon the
                    native powers, the speed and endurance of the coursers. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> So much, however, was Arvina interested by the manner and conversation of the
                    singular man by whose side he sat, and who was indeed laying himself out with
                    deep art to captivate him, and take his mind, as it were, by storm, now with the
                    boldest and most daring paradoxes; now with bursts of eloquent invective against
                    the oppression and aristocratic insolence of the cabal, which by his shewing
                    governed Rome; and now with sarcasm and pungent wit, that he saw but little of
                    the course, which he had come especially to look at. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Do you indeed ride so well, my Paullus?" asked his companion suddenly, as if
                    the thought had been suggested by some observation he had just made on the
                    competitors, as they passed in the second circuit. "So well, I mean, as Aurelius
                    Victor said; and would you undertake the combat of the horse and spear with
                    Caius Marcius?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Truly I would," said Arvina, blushing slightly; "I have interchanged many a
                    blow and thrust with young Varro, whom our master-at-arms holds better with the
                        <span class="tei tei-corr">spear</span> than Marcius; and I feel myself his equal. I
                    have been practising a good deal of late," he added modestly; "for, though
                    perhaps you know it not, I have been elected <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">decurio</span></span>;<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href="#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a> and, as
                    first chosen, leader of a troop, and am to take the field with the next
                    reinforcements that go out to Pontus to our great Pompey." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "The next reinforcements," replied Catiline with a meditative air: "ha! that may
                    be some time distant." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Not so, by Jupiter! my Sergius; we are already <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page86">[pg 86]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                    ordered to hold ourselves in readiness to march for Brundusium, where we shall
                    ship for Pontus. I fancy we shall set forth as soon as the consular comitia have
                    been held." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "It may be so," said the other; "but I do not think it. There may fall out that
                    which shall rather summon Pompey homeward, than send more men to join him. That
                    is a very handsome dagger," he broke off, interrupting himself suddenly—"where
                    did you get it? I should like much to get me such an one to give to my friend
                    Cethegus, who has a taste for such things. I wonder, however, at your wearing it
                    so openly." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Taken completely by surprise, Arvina answered hastily, "I found it last night;
                    and I wear it, hoping to find the owner." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "By Hercules!" said the conspirator laughing; "I would not take so much pains,
                    were I you. But, do you hear, I have partly a mind myself to claim it." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No! you were better not," said Paullus, gravely; "besides, you can get one just
                    like this, without risking any thing. Volero, the cutler, in the Sacred Way,
                    near Vesta's temple, has one precisely like to this for sale. He made this too,
                    he tells me; though he will not tell me to whom he sold it; but that shall soon
                    be got out of him, notwithstanding." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ha! are you so anxious in the matter? it would oblige you, then, if I should
                    confess myself the loser! Well, I don't want to buy another; I want this very
                    one. I believe I must claim it." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He spoke with an emphasis so singular; impressive, and at the same time
                    half-derisive, and with so strangely-meaning an expression, that Paullus indeed
                    scarcely knew what to think; but, in the mean time, he had recovered his own
                    self-possession, and merely answered—</p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I think you had better not; it would perhaps be dangerous!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Dangerous? Ha! that is another motive. I love danger! verily, I believe I must;
                    yes! I must claim it." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "What!" exclaimed Paullus, turning pale from excitement; "Is it yours? Do you
                    say that it is yours?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Look! look!" exclaimed Catiline, springing to his feet; "here they come, here
                    they come now; this is the last <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page87">[pg 87]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>round. By the gods!
                    but they are gallant horses, and well matched! See how the bay courser stretches
                    himself, and how quickly he gathers! The bay! the bay has it for five hundred
                    sesterces!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I wager you," said a dissolute-looking long-haired youth; "I wager you five
                    hundred, Catiline. I say the gray horse wins." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Be it so, then," shouted Catiline; "the bay, the bay! spur, spur, Aristius
                    Fuscus, Aurelius gains on you; spur, spur!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "The gray, the gray! There is not a horse in Rome can touch Aurelius Victor's
                    gray South-wind!" replied the other. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And in truth, Victor's Gallic courser repaid his master's vaunts; for he made,
                    though he had seemed beat, so desperate a rally, that he rushed past the bay
                    Arab almost at the goal, and won by a clear length amidst the roars of the glad
                    spectators. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I have lost, plague on it!" exclaimed Catiline; "and here is Clodius expects to
                    be paid on the instant, I'll be sworn." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And as he spoke, the debauchee with whom he had betted came up, holding his left
                    hand extended, tapping its palm with the forefinger of the right. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I told you so," he said, "I told you so; where be the sesterces?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "You must needs wait a while; I have not my purse with me," Catiline began. But
                    Paullus interrupted him— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I have, I have, my Sergius; permit me to accommodate you." And suiting the
                    action to the word, he gave the conspirator several large gold coins, adding,
                    "you can repay me when it suits you." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "That will be never," said Clodius with a sneer; "you don't know Lucius
                    Catiline, I see, young man." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ay, but he does!" replied the other, with a sarcastic grin; "for Catiline never
                    forgets a friend, or forgives a foe. Can Clodius say the same?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But Clodius merely smiled, and walked off, clinking the money he had won
                    tauntingly in his hand. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "What now, I wonder, is the day destined to bring forth?" said the conspirator,
                    making no more allusion to the dagger. </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page88">[pg 88]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "A contest now between myself, Aristius, and Aurelius, in the five games of the
                        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quinquertium</span></span>, and then a foot race in the heaviest
                    panoply." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ha! can you beat them?" asked Catiline, regarding Arvina with an interest that
                    grew every moment keener, as he saw more of his strength and daring spirit. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I can try." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Shall I bet on you?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "If you please. I can beat them in some, I think; and, as I said, I will try in
                    all." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> More words followed, for Paullus hastened away to strip and anoint himself for
                    the coming struggle; and in a little while the strife itself succeeded. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> To describe this would be tedious; but suffice it, that while he won decidedly
                    three games of the five, Paullus was beat in none; and that in the armed foot
                    race, the most toilsome and arduous exercise of the Campus, he not only beat his
                    competitors with ease; but ran the longest course, carrying the most ponderous
                    armature and shield, in shorter time than had been performed within many years
                    on the Field of Mars. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Catiline watched him eagerly all the while, inspecting him as a purchaser would
                    a horse he was about to buy; and then, muttering to himself, "We must have him!"
                    walked up to join him as he finished the last exploit. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Will you dine with me, Paullus," he said, "to-day, and meet the loveliest women
                    you can see in Rome, and no prudes either?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Willingly," he replied; "but I must swim first in the Tiber!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Be it so, there is time enough; I will swim also." And they moved down in
                    company toward the river. </p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> About three hours later than the scene in the Campus Martius, which had occurred
                    a little after noon, Catiline was standing richly dressed in a bright
                        saffron<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href="#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a> robe, something longer than the
                    ordinary tunic, flowered with sprigs of purple, in the inmost chamber of the
                    woman's apartments, in his own heavily mortgaged mansion. His wife, Aurelia
                    Orestilla, sat beside him on a low stool, a woman of the most superb and queenly
                    beauty—for whom it was believed that he had plunged himself into the deepest
                    guilt—and still, although past the prime of Italian womanhood, possessing
                    charms that might well account for the most insane passion. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A slave was listening with watchful and half terrified attention to the
                    injunctions of his lord—for Catiline was an unscrupulous and severe
                    master—and, as he ceased speaking, he made a deep genuflexion and retired. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> No sooner had he gone than Catiline turned quickly to the lady, whose lovely
                    face wore some marks of displeasure, and said rather shortly, </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "You have not gone to her, my Aurelia. There is no time to lose; the young man
                    will be here soon, and if they meet, ere you have given her the cue, all will be
                    lost." </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page90">[pg 90]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I do not like it, my Sergius," said the woman, rising, but making no movement
                    to leave the chamber. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And why not, I beseech you, madam?" he replied angrily; "or what is there in
                    that which I desire you to tell the girl to do, that you have not done twenty
                    times yourself, and Fulvia, and Sempronia, and half Rome's noblest ladies? Tush!
                    I say, tush! go do it." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "She is my daughter, Sergius," answered Aurelia, in a tone of deep tenderness;
                    "a daughter's honor must be something to every mother!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And a son's life to every father!" said Catiline with a fierce sneer. "I had a
                    son once, I remember. You wished to enter an <a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href="#note_14"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">empty</span></span> house on the day of your
                    marriage feast. I do not think you found him in your way! Besides, for honor—if
                    I read Lucia's eyes rightly, there is not much of that to emperil." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> When he spoke of his son, she covered her face in her richly jewelled hands, and
                    a slight shudder shook her whole frame. When she looked up again, she was pale
                    as death, and her lips quivered as she asked— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Must I, then? Oh! be merciful, my Sergius." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "You must, Aurelia!" he replied sternly, "and that now. Our fortunes, nay, our
                    lives, depend on it!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">All</span></span>—must she give all, Lucius?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "All that he asks! But fear not, he shall wed her, when our plans shall be
                    crowned with triumph!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Will you swear it?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "By all the Gods! he shall! by all the Furies, if you will, by Earth, and
                    Heaven, and Hades!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I will go," she replied, something reassured, "and prepare her for the task!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "The task!" he muttered with his habitual sneer. "Daintily worded, fair one; but
                    it will not, I fancy, prove a hard one; Paullus is young and handsome; and our
                    soft Lucia has, methinks, something of her mother's yielding tenderness." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Do you reproach me with it, Sergius?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Nay! rather I adore thee for it, loveliest one; but go and prepare our Lucia."
                    Then, as she left the room, the dark scowl settled down on his black brow, and
                    he clinched his hand as he said— </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page91">[pg 91]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "She waxes stubborn—let her beware! She is not half so young as she was; and
                    her beauty wanes as fast as my passion for it; let her beware how she crosses
                    me!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> While he was speaking yet a slave entered, and announced that Paullus Cæcilius
                    Arvina had arrived, and Curius, and the noble Fulvia; and as he received the
                    tidings the frown passed away from the brow of the conspirator, and putting on
                    his mask of smooth, smiling dissimulation, he went forth to meet his guests. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They were assembled in the tablinum, or saloon, Arvina clad in a violet colored
                    tunic, sprinkled with flowers in their natural hues, and Curius—a slight
                    keen-looking man, with a wild, proud expression, giving a sort of interest to a
                    countenance haggard from the excitement of passion, in one of rich crimson,
                    fringed at the wrists and neck with gold. Fulvia, his paramour, a woman famed
                    throughout Rome alike for her licentiousness and beauty, was hanging on his arm,
                    glittering with chains and carcanets, and bracelets of the costliest gems, in
                    her fair bosom all too much displayed for a matron's modesty; on her round
                    dazzling arms; about her swan-like neck; wreathed in the profuse tresses of her
                    golden hair—for she was that unusual and much admired being, an Italian
                    blonde—and, spanning the circumference of her slight waist. She was, indeed, a
                    creature exquisitely bright and lovely, with such an air of mild and angelic
                    candor pervading her whole face, that you would have sworn her the most
                    innocent, the purest of her sex. Alas! that she was indeed almost the vilest!
                    that she was that rare monster, a woman, who, linked with every crime and
                    baseness that can almost unsex a woman, preserves yet in its height, one eminent
                    and noble virtue, one half-redeeming trait amidst all her infamy, in her proud
                    love of country! Name, honor, virtue, conscience, womanhood, truth, piety, all,
                    all, were sacrificed to her rebellious passions. But to her love of country she
                    could have sacrificed those very passions! That frail abandoned wretch was still
                    a Roman—might have been in a purer age a heroine of Rome's most glorious. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Welcome, most lovely Fulvia," exclaimed the host, gliding softly into the room.
                    "By Mars! the most favored of immortals! You must have stolen Aphrodite's
                    cestus! Saw you her ever look so beautiful, my Paullus? You do well to put those
                    sapphires in your hair, for they wax<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page92">[pg 92]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> pale and dim
                    besides the richer azure of your eyes; and the dull gold in which they are
                    enchased sets off the sparkling splendor of your tresses. What, Fulvia, know you
                    not young Arvina—one of the great Cæcilii? By Hercules! my Curius, he won the
                    best of the quinquertium from such competitors as Victor and Aristius Fuscus,
                    and ran twelve stadii, with the heaviest breast-plate and shield in the armory,
                    quicker than it has been performed since the days of Licinius Celer. I prithee,
                    know, and cherish him, my friends, for I would have him one of us. In truth I
                    would, my Paullus." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The flattering words of the tempter, and the more fascinating smiles and glances
                    of the bewitching siren, were not thrown away on the young noble; and these,
                    with the soft perfumed atmosphere, the splendidly voluptuous furniture of the
                    saloon, and the delicious music, which was floating all the while upon his ears
                    from the blended instruments and voices of unseen minstrels, conspired to plunge
                    his senses into a species of effeminate and luxurious languor, which suited well
                    the ulterior views of Catiline. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "One thing alone has occurred," resumed the host, after some moments spent in
                    light jests and trivial conversation, "to decrease our pleasure: Cethegus was to
                    have dined with us to-day, and Decius Brutus, with his inimitable wife
                    Sempronia. But they have disappointed us; and, save Aurelia only, and our poor
                    little Lucia, there will be none but ourselves to eat my Umbrian boar." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Have you a boar, my Sergius?" exclaimed Curius, eagerly, who was addicted to
                    the pleasures of the table, almost as much as the charms of women. "By Pan, the
                    God of Hunters! we are in luck to-day!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "But wherefore comes not Sempronia?" inquired Fulvia, not very much displeased
                    by the absence of a rival beauty. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Brutus is called away, it appears, suddenly to Tarentum upon business; and
                    she"— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Prefers entertaining our Cethegus, alone in her own house, I fancy,"
                    interrupted Fulvia. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Exactly so," replied Catiline, with a smile of meaning. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Happy Cethegus," said Arvina. </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page93">[pg 93]</span><a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Do you think her so handsome?" asked Fulvia, favoring him with one of her most
                    melting glances. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "The handsomest woman," he replied, "with but one exception, I ever had the luck
                    to look upon." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Indeed!—and pray, who is the exception?" asked the lady, very tartly. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> There happened to be lying on a marble slab, near to the place where they were
                    standing, a small round mirror of highly polished steel, set in a frame of
                    tortoiseshell and gold. Paullus had noticed it before she spoke; and taking it
                    up without a moment's pause, he raised it to her face. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Look!" he said, "look into that, and blush at your question." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Prettily said, my Paullus; thy wit is as fleet as thy foot is speedy," said the
                    conspirator. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Flatterer!" whispered the lady, evidently much delighted; and then, in a lower
                    voice she added, "Do you indeed think so?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Else may I never hope." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But at this moment the curtains were drawn aside, and Orestilla entered from the
                    gallery of the peristyle, accompanied by her daughter Lucia. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The latter was a girl of about eighteen years old, and of appearance so
                    remarkable, that she must not be passed unnoticed. In person she was extremely
                    tall and slender, and at first sight you would have supposed her thin; until the
                    wavy outlines of the loose robe of plain white linen which she wore, undulating
                    at every movement of her form, displayed the exquisite fulness of her swelling
                    bust, and the voluptuous roundness of all her lower limbs. Her arms, which were
                    bare to the shoulders, where her gown was fastened by two studs of gold, were
                    quite unadorned, by any gem or bracelet, and although beautifully moulded, were
                    rather slender than full. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Her face did not at first sight strike you more than her person, as being
                    beautiful; for it was singularly still and inexpressive when at rest—although
                    all the features were fine and classically regular—and was almost unnaturally
                    pale and hueless. The mouth only, had any thing of warmth, or color, or
                    expression; and what expression there was, was not pleasing, for although soft
                    and winning, it was sensual to the last degree. </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page94">[pg 94]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Her manner, however, contradicted this; for she slided into the circle, with
                    downcast eyes, the long dark silky lashes only visible in relief against the
                    marble paleness of her cheek, as if she were ashamed to raise them from the
                    ground; her whole air being that of a girl oppressed with overwhelming
                    bashfulness, to an extent almost painful. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Why, what is this, Aurelia," exclaimed Catiline, as if he were angry, although
                    in truth the whole thing was carefully preconcerted. "Wherefore is Lucia thus
                    strangely clad? Is it, I pray you, in scorn of our noble guests, that she wears
                    only this plain morning stola?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Pardon her, I beseech you, good my Sergius," answered his wife, with a
                    painfully simulated smile; "you know how over-timid she is and bashful; she had
                    determined not to appear at dinner, had I not laid my commands on her. Her very
                    hair, you see, is not braided." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ha! this is ill done, my girl Lucia," answered Catiline. "What will my young
                    friend, Arvina, think of you, who comes hither to-day, for the first time? For
                    Curius and our lovely Fulvia, I care not so much, seeing they know your whims;
                    but I am vexed, indeed, that Paullus should behold you thus in disarray, with
                    your hair thus knotted like a slave girl's, on your neck." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Like a Dryad's, rather, or shy Oread's of Diana's train—beautiful hair!"
                    replied the youth, whose attention had been called to the girl by this
                    conversation; and who, having thought her at first unattractive rather than
                    otherwise, had now discovered the rare beauties of her lythe and slender figure,
                    and detected, as he thought, a world of passion in her serpent-like and sinuous
                    motions. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> She raised her eyes to meet his slowly, as he spoke; gazed into them for one
                    moment, and then, as if ashamed of what she had done, dropped them again
                    instantly; while a bright crimson flush shot like a stream of lava over her
                    pallid face, and neck, and arms; yes, her arms blushed, and her hands to the
                    finger ends! It was but one moment, that those large lustrous orbs looked full
                    into his, swimming in liquid Oriental languor, yet flashing out beams of
                    consuming fire. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Yet Paullus Arvina felt the glance, like an electrical influence, through every
                    nerve and artery of his body, and trembled at its power. </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page95">[pg 95]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was a minute before he could collect himself enough to speak to her, for all
                    the rest had moved away a little, and left them standing together; and when he
                    did so, his voice faltered, and his manner was so much agitated, that she must
                    have been blind, indeed, and stupid, not to perceive it. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And Lucia was not blind nor stupid. No! by the God of Love! an universe of wild
                    imaginative intellect, an ocean of strange whirling thoughts, an Etna of fierce
                    and fiery passions, lay buried beneath that calm, bashful, almost awkward
                    manner. Many bad thoughts were there, many unmaidenly imaginings, many
                    ungoverned and most evil passions; but there was also much that was partly good;
                    much that might have been all good, and high and noble, had it been properly
                    directed; but alas! as much pains had been taken to corrupt and deprave that
                    youthful understanding, and to inflame those nascent passions, as are devoted by
                    good parents to developing the former, and repressing the growth of the latter. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> As it was, self indulged, and indulged by others, she was a creature of impulse
                    entirely, ill regulated and ungovernable. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Intended from the first to be a tool in his own hands, whenever he might think
                    fit to use her, she had in no case hitherto run counter to the views of
                    Catiline; because, so long as his schemes were agreeable to her inclinations,
                    and favorable to her pleasures, she was quite willing to be his tool; though by
                    no means unconscious of the fact that he meant her to be such. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> What might be the result should his wishes cross her own, the arch conspirator
                    had never given himself the pains to enquire; for, like the greater part of
                    voluptuaries, regarding women as mere animals, vastly inferior in mind and
                    intellect to men, he had entirely overlooked her mental qualifications, and
                    fancied her a being of as small moral capacity, as he knew her to be of strong
                    physical organization. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He was mistaken; as wise men often are, and deeply, perhaps fatally. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> There was not probably a girl in all Italy, in all the world, who would so
                    implicitly have followed his directions, as long as to do so gratified her
                    passions, and clash<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page96">[pg 96]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ed not with her indomitable will,
                    to the sacrifice of all principle, and with the most total disregard of right or
                    wrong, as Lucia Orestilla; but certainly there was not one, who would have
                    resisted commands, threats, violence, more pertinaciously or dauntlessly, than
                    the same Lucia, should her will and his councils ever be set at twain. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> While Paullus was yet conversing in an under tone with this strange girl, and
                    becoming every moment more and more fascinated by the whole tone of her remarks,
                    which were free, and even bold, as contrasted with the bashful air and timid
                    glances which accompanied them, the curtains of the Tablinum were drawn apart,
                    and a soft symphony of flutes stealing in from the atrium, announced that the
                    dinner was prepared. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "My Curius," exclaimed Catiline, "I must entreat you to take charge of Fulvia; I
                    had proposed myself that pleasure, intending that you should escort Sempronia,
                    and Decius my own Orestilla; but, as it is, we will each abide by his own lady;
                    and Paullus here will pardon the youth and rawness of my Lucia." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "By heaven! I would wish nothing better," said Curius, taking Fulvia by the
                    hand, and leading her forward. "Should <span class="tei tei-corr">you,</span> Arvina?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Not I, indeed," replied Paullus, "if Lucia be content." And he looked to catch
                    her eye, as he took her soft hand in his own, but her face remained cold and
                    pale as marble, and her eye downcast. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> As they passed out, however, into the fauces, or passage leading to the
                    dining-room, Catiline added, </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "As we are all, I may say, one family and party, I have desired the slaves to
                    spread couches only; the ladies will recline with us, instead of sitting at the
                    board." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> At this moment, did Paullus fancy it? or did that beautiful pale girl indeed
                    press his fingers in her own? he could not be mistaken; and yet there was the
                    downcast eye, the immoveable cheek, and the unsmiling aspect of the rosy mouth.
                    But he returned the pressure, and that so significantly, that she at least could
                    not be mistaken; nor was she, for her eye again met his, with that deep amorous
                    languid glance; was bashfully withdrawn; and then met his again, glancing
                    askance through the dark fringed lids, and a quick flashing smile, and a burning
                    blush follow<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page97">[pg 97]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ed; and in a second's space she was again
                    as cold, as impassive as a marble statue. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They reached the triclinium, a beautiful oblong apartment, gorgeously painted
                    with arabesques of gold and scarlet upon a deep azure ground work. A circular
                    table, covered with a white cloth, bordered with a deep edge of purple and
                    deeper fringe of gold, stood in the centre, and around it three couches, nearly
                    of the same height with the board, each the segment of a circle, the three
                    forming a horse-shoe. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The couches were of the finest rosewood, inlaid with tortoiseshell and ivory and
                    brass, strewed with the richest tapestries, and piled with cushions glowing with
                    splendid needlework. And over all, upheld by richly moulded shafts of Corinthian
                    bronze, was a canopy of Tyrian purple, tasselled and fringed with gold. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The method of reclining at the table was, that the guests should place
                    themselves on the left side, propped partly by the left elbow and partly by a
                    pile of cushions; each couch being made to contain in general three persons, the
                    head of the second coming immediately below the right arm of the first, and the
                    third in like manner; the body of each being placed transversely, so as to allow
                    space for the limbs of the next below in front of him. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The middle place on each couch was esteemed the most honorable; and the middle
                    couch of the three was that assigned to guests of the highest rank, the master
                    of the feast, for the most, occupying the central position on the third or left
                    hand sofa. The slaves stood round the outer circuit of the whole, with the
                    cupbearers; but the carver, and steward, if he might so be termed, occupied that
                    side of the table which was left open to their attendance. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> On this occasion, there being but six guests in all, each gentleman assisted the
                    lady under his charge to recline, with her head comfortably elevated, near the
                    centre of the couch; and then took his station behind her, so that, if she
                    leaned back, her head would rest on his bosom, while he was enabled himself to
                    reach the table, and help himself or his fair partner, as need might be, to the
                    delicacies offered in succession. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Curius and Fulvia, he as of senatorial rank, and she as a noble matron, occupied
                    the highest places; Paullus and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page98">[pg 98]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Lucia reclined on the
                    right hand couch, and Catiline with Orestilla in his bosom, as the phrase ran,
                    on the left. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> No sooner were they all placed, and the due libation made of wine, with an
                    offering of salt, to the domestic Gods—a silver group of statues occupying the
                    centre of the board, where we should now place the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">plateau</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">epergne</span></span>, than a louder burst of music
                    ushered in three beautiful female slaves, in succinct tunics, like that seen in
                    the sculptures of Diana, with half the bosom bare, dancing and singing, and
                    carrying garlands in their hands of roses and myrtle, woven with strips of the
                    philyra, or inner bark of the linden tree, which was believed to be a specific
                    against intoxication. Circling around the board, in time to the soft music, they
                    crowned each of the guests, and sprinkled with rich perfumes the garments and
                    the hair of each; and then with more animated and eccentric gestures, as the
                    note of the flute waxed shriller and more piercing, they bounded from the
                    banquet hall, and were succeeded by six boys with silver basins, full of tepid
                    water perfumed with costly essences, and soft embroidered napkins, which they
                    handed to every banqueter to wash the hands before eating. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> This done, the music died away into a low faint close, and was silent; and in
                    the hush that followed, an aged slave bore round a mighty flask of Chian wine,
                    diluted with snow water, and replenished the goblets of stained glass, which
                    stood beside each guest; while another dispensed bread from a lordly basket of
                    wrought gilded scroll work. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And now the feast commenced, in earnest; as the first course, consisting of
                    fresh eggs boiled hard, with lettuce, radishes, endive and rockets, olives of
                    Venafrum, anchovies and sardines, and the choicest luxury of the day—hot
                    sausages served upon gridirons of silver, with the rich gravy dripping through
                    the bars upon a sauce of Syrian prunes and pomegranate berries—was placed upon
                    the board. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> For a time there was little conversation beyond the ordinary courtesies of the
                    table, and such trifling jests as were suggested by occurrences of the moment.
                    Yet still in the few words that passed from time to time, Paullus continued
                    often to convey his sentiments to Lucia in words <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page99">[pg 99]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of
                    double meaning; keenly marked, it is true, but seemingly unobserved by the wily
                    plotter opposite; and more than once in handing her the goblet, or loading her
                    plate with dainties, he took an opportunity again and again of pressing her not
                    unwilling hand. And still at every pressure he caught that soft momentary
                    glance, was it of love and passion, or of mere coquetry and girlish wantonness,
                    succeeded by the fleeting blush pervading face, neck, arms, and bosom. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Never had Paullus been so wildly fascinated; his heart throbbed and bounded as
                    if it would have burst his breast; his head swam with a sort of pleasurable
                    dizziness; his eyes were dim and suffused; and he scarce knew that he was
                    talking, though he was indeed the life of the whole company, voluble, witty,
                    versatile, and at times eloquent, so far as the topics of the day gave room for
                    eloquence. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And now, to the melody of Lydian lutes, two slaves introduced a huge silver
                    dish, loaded by the vast brawn of the Umbrian boar, garnished with leaves of
                    chervil, and floating in a rich sauce of anchovies, the dregs of Coan wine,
                    white pepper, vinegar, and olives. The carver brandished his knife in graceful
                    and fantastic gestures, proud of his honorable task; and as he plunged it into
                    the savory meat, and the delicious savor rushed up to his nostrils, he laid down
                    the blade, spread out his hands in an ecstacy, and cried aloud, "ye Gods, how
                    glorious!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Excellent well, my Glycon," cried Curius, delighted with the expressive
                    <span class="tei tei-sic">pantomine</span> of the well skilled Greek; "smells it so savory?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I have carved many a boar from Lucania and from Umbria also; to say nothing of
                    those from the Laurentian marshes, which are bad, seeing that they are fed on
                    reeds only and marsh grass; most noble Curius; and never put I knife into such
                    an one as this. There are two inches on it of pure fat, softer than marrow. He
                    was fed upon holm acorns, I'll be sworn, and sweet chesnuts, and caught in a
                    mild south wind!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Fewer words, you scoundrel," exclaimed Catiline, laughing at the fellow's
                    volubility, "and quicker carving, if you wish not to visit the pistrinum. You
                    have set Curius' mouth watering, so that he will be sped with longing, be<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>fore you have helped Fulvia and your mistress. Fill
                    up, you knaves, fill up; nay! not the Chian now; the Falernian from the Faustian
                    hills, or the Cæcuban? Which shall it be, my Curius?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "The Cæcuban, by all the Gods! I hold it the best vintage ever, and yours is
                    curious. Besides, the Falernian is too dry to drink before the meat. Afterward,
                    if, as Glycon says, the boar hath a flavor of the south, it will be excellent,
                    indeed." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Are as you as constant, Paullus, in your love for the boar, as these other
                    epicures?" cried Fulvia, who, despite the depreciating tone in which she spoke,
                    had sent her own plate for a second slice. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No! by the Gods! Fulvia," he replied, "I am but a sorry epicure, and I love the
                    boar better in his reedy fen, or his wild thicket on the Umbrian hills, with his
                    eye glaring red in rage, and his tusks white with foam, than girt with
                    condiments and spices upon a golden dish." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "A strange taste," said Curius, "I had for my part rather meet ten on the dining
                    table, than one in the oak woods." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Commend me to the boar upon the table likewise," said Catiline; "still, with my
                    friend Arvina at my side, and a good boarspear in my hand, I would like well to
                    bide the charge of a tusker! It is rare sport, by Hercules!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Wonderful beings you men are," said Fulvia, mincing her words affectedly, "ever
                    in search of danger; ever on the alert to kill; to shed blood, even if it be
                    your own! by Juno, I cannot comprehend it." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I can, I can," cried Lucia, raising her voice for the first time, so that it
                    could be heard by any others than her nearest neighbor; "right well can I
                    comprehend it; were I a man myself, I feel that I should pant for the battle.
                    The triumph would be more than rapture; and strife, for its own sake, maddening
                    bliss! Heavens! to see the gladiators wheel and charge; to see their swords
                    flash in the sun; and the red blood gush out unheeded; and the grim faces
                    flushed and furious; and the eyes greedily devouring the wounds of the foeman,
                    but all unconscious of their own; and the play of the muscular strong limbs; and
                    the terrible death grapple! And then the dull hissing sound of the death stroke;
                    and the voiceless parting of the bold <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>spirit! Ye
                    Gods! ye Gods! it is a joy, to live, and almost to die for!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Paullus Arvina looked at her in speechless wonder. The eyes so wavering and
                    downcast were now fixed, and steady, and burning with a passionate clear light;
                    there was a fiery flush on her cheek, not brief and evanescent; her ripe red
                    mouth was half open, shewing the snow white teeth biting the lower lip in the
                    excitement of her feelings. Her whole form seemed to be dilated and more
                    majestic than its wont. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Bravo! my girl; well said, my quiet Lucia!" exclaimed Catiline. "I knew not
                    that she had so much of mettle in her." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "You must have thought, then, that I belied my race," replied the girl,
                    unblushingly; "for it is whispered that you are my father, and I think <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></span> have looked on blood, and shed it before now!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Boar's blood, ha! Lucia; but you are blunt and brave to-night. Is it that
                    Paullus has inspired you?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Nay! I know not," she replied, half apathetically; "but I do know, that if I
                    ever love, it shall be a hero; a man that would rather lie in wait until dawn to
                    receive the fierce boar rushing from the brake upon his spear, than until
                    midnight to enfold a silly girl in his embrace." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Then will you never love me, Lucia," answered Curius. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Never, indeed!" said she; "it must be a man whom I will love; and there is
                    nothing manly about thee, save thy vices!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "It is for those that most people love me," replied Curius, nothing
                    disconcerted. "Now Cato has nothing of the man about him but the virtues; and I
                    should like to know who ever thought of loving Cato." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I never heard of any body loving Cato," said Fulvia, quietly. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "But I have," answered the girl, almost fiercely; "none of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></span> love him; nor do I love him; because he is too high and noble, to be
                    dishonored by the love of such as I am; but all the good, and great, and
                    generous, do love him, and will love his memory for countless ages! I would to
                    God, I could love him!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "What fury has possessed her?" whispered Catiline <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to
                    Orestilla; "what ails her to talk thus? first to proclaim herself my daughter,
                    and now to praise Cato?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Do not ask me!" replied Aurelia in the same tone; "she was a strange girl ever;
                    and I cannot say, if she likes this task that you have put upon her." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "More wine, ho! bring more wine! Drink we each man to his mistress, each lady to
                    her lover in secrecy and silence!" cried the master of the revel. "Fill up! fill
                    up! let it be pure, and sparkling to the brim." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But Fulvia, irritated a little by what had passed, would not be silent; although
                    she saw that Catiline was annoyed at the character the conversation had assumed,
                    and ere the slave had filled up the beakers she addressed Lucia— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And wherefore, dearest, would you love Cato? I could as soon love the statue of
                    Accius Nævius, with his long beard, on the steps of the Comitium; he were scarce
                    colder, or less comely than your Cato." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Because to love virtue is still something, if we be vicious even; and, if I am
                    not virtuous myself, at least I have not lost the sense that it were good to be
                    so!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I never knew that you were not virtuous, my Lucia," interposed her mother;
                    "affectionate and pious you have ever been." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And obedient!" added Catiline, with strong emphasis. "Your mother, my Lucia,
                    and myself, return thanks to the Gods daily for giving us so good a child." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Do you?" replied the girl, scornfully; "the Gods must have merry times, then,
                    for that must needs make them laugh! But good or bad, I respect the great; and,
                    if I ever love, it will be, as I said, a great and a good man." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I fear you will never love me, Lucia," whispered Paullus in her ear, unheard
                    amid the clash of knives and flagons, and the pealing of a fresh strain of
                    music, which ushered in the king of fish, the grand conger, garnished with
                    prawns and soused in pungent sauce. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Wherefore not?" she replied, meeting his eye with a furtive sidelong glance. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Because I, for one, had rather watch till midnight fifty times, in the hope
                    only of clasping Lucia, once, in my embrace; than once until dawn, to kill fifty
                    boars of Umbria." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> She made no answer; but looked up into his face as if <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to see whether he was in earnest, with an affectionate and pleading glance;
                    and then pressed her unsandalled foot against his. A moment or two afterward, he
                    perceived the embroidered table cover had been drawn up, with the intent of
                    protecting her dress from the sauces of the fish which she was eating, in such a
                    manner as to conceal the greater part of her person. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Observing this, and excited beyond all restraint of ordinary prudence, by the
                    consciousness of her manner, he profited by the chance to steal his arm about
                    her waist; and to his surprise, almost as much as his delight, he felt his hand
                    clasped instantly in hers, and pressed upon her throbbing heart. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The blood gushed like molten fire through his veins. The fascinations of the
                    siren had prevailed. The voice of the charmer had been heard, charming him but
                    too wisely. And for the moment, fool that he was, he fancied he loved Lucia, and
                    his own pure and innocent and lovely Julia was forgotten! Forgotten, and for
                    whom! </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Catiline had not lost one word, one movement of the young couple; and he
                    perceived, that, although there was clearly something at work in the girl's
                    bosom which he did not comprehend, she had at least obeyed his commands in
                    captivating Paullus; and he now doubted not but she would persevere, from vanity
                    or passion, and bind him down a fettered captive to her will. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Determined to lose nothing by want of exertion, the traitor circulated now the
                    fiery goblet as fast as possible, till every brain was heated more or less, and
                    every cheek flushed, even of the women, by the inspiring influence of the wine
                    cup. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> All dainties that were known in those days ministered to his feast; oysters from
                    Baiæ; pheasants—a rarity but lately introduced, since Pompey's conquests in the
                    east—had been brought all the way from Phasis upon the southern shores of the
                    Black Sea; and woodcock from the valleys of Ionia, and the watery plains of
                    Troas, to load the tables of the luxurious masters of the world. Livers of
                    geese, forced to an unnatural size by cramming the unhappy bird with figs; and
                    turbot fricasseed in cream, and peacocks stuffed with truffles, were on the
                    board of Catiline that day, as on the boards of many another noble <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Roman; and the wines by which these rare dainties
                    were diluted, differed but little, as wisest critics say, from the madeiras and
                    the sherries of the nineteenth century. For so true is it, that under the sun
                    there is nothing new, that in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">foix gras</span></span> of Strasburg,
                    in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">turbot à la crême</span></span>, and in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dindons aux truffes</span></span> of the French metropolis, the gastronomes of
                    modern days have only reproduced the dishes, whereon Lucullus and Hortensius
                    feasted before the Christian era. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The day passed pleasantly to all, but to Paullus Arvina it flew like a dream,
                    like a delirious trance, from which, could he have consulted his own will, he
                    would never have awakened. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> With the dessert, and the wine cup, the myrtle branch and the lute went round,
                    and songs were warbled by sweet voices, full of seductive thoughts and words of
                    passion. At length the lamps were lighted, and the women arose to quit the hall,
                    leaving the ruder sex to prolong the revel; but as Lucia rose, she again pressed
                    the fingers of Arvina, and whispered a request that he would see her once more
                    ere he left the house. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He promised; but as he did so, his heart sank within him; for dearly as he
                    wished it, he believed he had promised that which would prove impossible. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But in a little while, chance, as he thought it, favored him; for seeing that he
                    refused the wine cup, Catiline, after rallying him some time, good humoredly
                    said with a laugh, "Come, my Arvina, we must not be too hard on you. You have
                    but a young head, though a stout one. Curius and I are old veterans of the camp,
                    old revellers, and love the wine cup better than the bright eyes of beauty, or
                    the minstrel's lute. Thou, I will swear it, wouldst rather now be listening to
                    Lucia's lyre, and may be fingering it thyself, than drinking with us roisterers!
                    Come, never blush, boy, we were all young once! Confess, if I am right! The
                    women you will find, if you choose to seek them, in the third chamber on the
                    left, beyond the inner peristyle. We all love freedom here; nor are we rigid
                    censors. Curius and I will drain a flagon or two more, and then join you." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Muttering something not very comprehensible about his exertions in the morning,
                    and his inability to drink any <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>more, Paullus arose,
                    delighted to effect his escape on terms so easy, and left the triclinium
                    immediately in quest of his mistress. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> As he went out, Catiline burst into one of his sneering laughs, and exclaimed,
                    "He is in; by Pan, the hunter's God! he is in the death-toil already! May I
                    perish ill, if he escape it." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Why, in the name of all the Gods, do you take so much pains with him," said
                    Curius; "he is a stout fellow, and I dare say a brave one; and will make a good
                    legionary, or an officer perhaps; but he is raw, and a fool to boot!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Raw, but no fool! I can assure you," answered Catiline; "no more a fool than I
                    am. And we must have him, he is necessary!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "He will be necessary soon to that girl of yours; she has gone mad, I think, for
                    love of him. I never did believe in philtres; but this is well nigh enough to
                    make one do so." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Pshaw!" answered Catiline; "it is thou that art raw now, and a fool, Curius.
                    She is no more in love with him than thou art; it was all acting—right good
                    acting: for it did once well nigh deceive me who devised it; but still, only
                    acting. I ordered her to win him at all hazards." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "At all hazards?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Aye! at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></span>." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I wish you would give her the like orders touching me, if she obey so readily." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I would, if it were necessary; which it is not. First, because I have you as
                    firmly mine, as need be; and secondly, because Fulvia would have her heart's
                    blood ere two days had gone, and that would ill suit me; for the sly jade is
                    useful." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Take care she prove not too sly for you, Sergius. She may obey your orders in
                    this thing; but she does so right willingly. She loves the boy, I tell you, as
                    madly as Venus loved Adonis, or Phædra Hyppolitus; she would pursue him if he
                    fled from her." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "She loves him no more than she loves the musty statue of my stout grandsire,
                    Sergius Silo." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "You will see one day. Meanwhile, look that she fool you not." </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> While they were speaking, Paullus had reached the entrance of the chamber
                    indicated; and, opening the door, had entered, expecting to find the three women
                    assembled at some feminine sport or occupation. But fortune again favored
                    him—opportune fortune! </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> For Lucia was alone, expecting him, prepared for his entrance at any moment;
                    yet, when he came, how unprepared, how shocked, how terrified! </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> For she had unclasped her stola upon both her shoulders, and suffered it to fall
                    down to her girdle which kept it in its place about her hips. But above those
                    she was dressed only in a tunic of that loose fabric, a sort of silken gauze,
                    which was called woven air, and was beginning to be worn very much by women of
                    licentious character; this dress—if that indeed could be called a dress, which
                    displayed all the outlines of the shape, all the hues of the glowing skin every
                    minute blue vein that meandered over the lovely bosom—was wrought in alternate
                    stripes of white and silver; and nothing can be imagined more beautiful than the
                    effect of its semi-transparent veil concealing just enough to leave some scope
                    for the imagination, displaying more than enough for the most prodigal of
                    beauty. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> She was employed in dividing her long jet-black hair with a comb of
                    mother-of-pearl as he entered; but she dropped both the hair and comb, and
                    started to her feet with a simulated scream, covering her beautiful bust with
                    her two hands, as if she had been taken absolutely by surprise. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But Paullus had been drinking freely, and Paullus saw, moreover, that she was
                    not offended; and, if surprised, surprised not unpleasantly by his coming. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He sprang forward, caught her in his arms, and clasping her to his bosom almost
                    smothered her with kisses. But shame on her, fast and furiously as he kissed,
                    she kissed as closely back. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Lucia, sweet Lucia, do you then love me?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "More than my life—more than my country—more than the Gods! my brave, my noble
                    Paullus." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And will you then be mine—all mine, my Lucia?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Yours, Paul?" she faltered, panting as if with agitation upon his bosom; "am I
                    not yours already? but no, no, no!" she exclaimed, tearing herself from his
                    embrace. "No <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>no! I had forgotten. My father! no; I

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "You are his enemy. You have discovered, will betray him." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No, by the great Gods! you are mad, Lucia. I have discovered nothing; nor if I
                    knew him to be the slayer of my father, would I betray him! never, never!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Will you swear <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></span>?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Swear what?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Never, whatever you may learn, to betray him to any living man: never to carry
                    arms, or give evidence against him; but faithfully and <span class="tei tei-sic">stedfastly</span> to
                    follow him through virtue and through vice, in life and unto death; to live for
                    him, and die with him, unless I release you of your oath and restore you to
                    freedom, which I will never do!" </p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Then I am yours," she sighed; "all, and for ever!" and sank into his arms, half
                    fainting with the violence of that prolonged excitement. </p>

                    earth, when Paullus issued stealthily, like a guilty thing, from Lucia's
                    chamber. No step or sound had come near the door, no voice had called on either,
                    though they had lingered there for hours in endearments, which, as he judged the
                    spirit of his host, would have cost him his life, if suspected; and though he
                    never dreamed of connivance, he did think it strange that a man so wary and
                    suspicious as Catiline was held to be, should have so fallen from his wonted
                    prudence, as to betray his adopted daughter's honor by granting this most fatal
                    opportunity. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He met no member of the family in the dim-lighted peristyle; the passages were
                    silent and deserted; no gay domestic circle was collected in the tablinum, no
                    slaves were waiting in the atrium; and, as he stole forth cautiously with
                    guarded footsteps, Arvina almost fancied that he had been forgotten; and that
                    the master of the house believed him to have retired when he left the dining
                    hall. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was not long, however, before he was undeceived; for as he entered the
                    vestibule, and was about to lay his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>hand on the lock
                    of the outer door, a tall dark figure, which he recognized instantly to be that
                    of his host, stepped forward from a side-passage, and stretched out his arm in
                    silence, forbidding him, by that imperious gesture, to proceed. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ha! you have tarried long," he said in a deep guarded whisper, "our Lucia truly
                    is a most soft and fascinating creature; you found her so, is it not true, my
                    Paullus?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> There was something singular in the manner in which these words were uttered,
                    half mocking, and half serious; something between a taunting and triumphant
                    assertion of a fact, and a bitter question; but nothing that betokened anger or
                    hostility, or offended pride in the speaker. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Still Paullus was so much taken by surprise, and so doubtful of his
                    entertainer's meaning, and the extent of his knowledge, that he remained
                    speechless in agitated and embarrassed silence. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "What, have the girl's kisses clogged your lips, so that they can give out no
                    sound? By the gods! they were close enough to do so." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Catiline!" he exclaimed, starting back in astonishment, and half expecting to
                    feel a dagger in his bosom. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Tush! tush! young man—think you the walls in the house of Catiline have no
                    ears, nor eyes? Paullus Arvina, I know all!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "All?" faltered the youth, now utterly aghast. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ay, all!" replied the conspirator, with a harsh triumphant laugh. "Lucia has
                    given herself to you; and you have sold yourself to Catiline! By all the fiends
                    of Hades, better it were for you, rash boy, that you had ne'er been born, than
                    now to fail me!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Arvina, trembling with the deep consciousness of hospitality betrayed, and
                    feeling the first stings of remorse already, stood thunderstricken, and unable
                    to articulate. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Speak!" thundered Catiline; "speak! art thou not mine—mine soul and
                    body—sworn to be mine forever?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Alas! the fatal oath, sworn in the heat of passion, flashed on his soul, and he
                    answered humbly, and in a faint low voice, how different from his wonted tones
                    of high and manly confidence— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I am sworn, Catiline!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "See then that thou be not forsworn. Little thou <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                    dream'st yet, unto what thou art sworn, or unto whom; but know this, that hell
                    itself, with all its furies, would fall short of the tortures that await the
                    traitor!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I am, at least, no traitor!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No! traitor! Ha!" cried Catiline, "is it an honest deed to creep into the bosom
                    of a daughter of the house which entertained thee as a friend!—No! Traitor—ha!
                    ha! ha! thou shalt ere long learn better—ha! ha! ha!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And he laughed with the fearful sneering mirth, which was never excited in his
                    breast, but by things perilous and terrible and hateful. In a moment, however,
                    he repressed his merriment, and added— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Give me that poniard thou didst wear this morning. It is mine." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Thine!" cried the unhappy youth, starting back, as if he had received a blow;
                    "thine, Catiline!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Aye!" he replied, in a hoarse voice, looking into the very eyes of Paul. "I am
                    the slayer of the slave, and regret only that I slew him without torture. Know
                    you whose slave he was, by any chance?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "He was the Consul's slave," answered Arvina, almost mechanically—for he was
                    utterly bewildered by all that had passed—"Medon, my freedman Thrasea's
                    cousin." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "The Consul's, ha!—which Consul's? speak! fool! speak, ere I tear it from your
                    throat; Cicero's, ha?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Cicero's, Catiline!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Here is a coil; and knows he of this matter? I mean Cicero." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "He knows it." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "That is to say, you told him. Aye! this morning, after I spoke with you. I
                    comprehend; and you shewed him the poniard. So! so! so! Well, give it to me; I
                    will tell you what to do, hereafter." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I have it not with me, Sergius," he replied, thoroughly daunted and dismayed. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "See that you meet me then, bringing it with you, at Egeria's cave, as fools
                    call it, in the valley of Muses, at the fourth hour of night to-morrow. In the
                    meantime, beware that you tell no man aught of this, nor that the instrument was
                    bought of Volero. Ha! dost thou hear me?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I hear, Catiline." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And wilt obey?" </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And will obey." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "So shall it go well with thee, and we shall be fast friends forever. Good
                    repose to thee, good my Paullus." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And Lucia?" he replied, but in a voice of inquiry; for all that he had heard of
                    the tremendous passions and vindictive fury of the conspirator, flashed on his
                    mind, and he fancied that he knew not what of vengeance would fall on the head
                    of the soft beauty. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Hath played her part rarely!" answered the monster, as he dismissed him from
                    the door, which he opened with his own hand. "Be true, and you shall see her
                    when you will; betray us, and both you and she shall live in agonies, that shall
                    make you call upon death fifty times, ere he relieve you." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And with a menacing gesture, he closed and barred the door behind him. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Played her part rarely!" The words sank down into his soul with a chilling
                    weight, that seemed to crush every energy and hope. Played her part! Then he was
                    a dupe—the very dupe of the fiend's arch mock, to lip a wanton, and believe her
                    chaste—the dupe of a designing harlot; the sworn tool and slave of a
                    murderer—a monster, who had literally sold his own child's honor. For all the
                    world well knew, that, although Lucia passed for his adopted daughter only, she
                    was his natural offspring by Aurelia Orestilla, before their impious marriage. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Well might he gnash his teeth, and beat his breast, and tear his dark hair by
                    handfulls from his head; well might he groan and curse. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But oh! the inconsistency of man! While he gave vent to all the anguish of his
                    rage in curses against her, the soft partner of his guilt, and at the same time,
                    its avenger; against the murderer and the traitor, now his tyrant; he utterly
                    forgot that his own dereliction, from the paths of rectitude and honor, had led
                    him into the dark toils, in which he now seemed involved beyond any hope of
                    extrication. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He forgot, that to satisfy an insane and unjustifiable love of adventure, and a
                    false curiosity, he had associated himself with a man whom he believed, if he
                    did not actually know, to be infamous and capable of any crime. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He forgot, that, admitted into that man's house in friend<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ship, he had attempted to undermine his daughter's honor; and had
                    felt no remorse, till he learned that his success was owing to connivance—that
                    his own treason had been met and repaid by deeper treason. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He forgot, that for a wanton's love, he had betrayed the brightest, and the
                    purest being that drew the breath of life, from the far Alps, to the blue waters
                    of the far Tarentum—that he had broken his soul's plighted faith—that he was
                    himself, first, a liar, perjurer, and villain. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Alas! it is the inevitable consequence, the first fruit, as it were, of crime,
                    that guilt is still prolific; that the commission of the first ill deed, leads
                    almost surely to the commission of a second, of a third, until the soul is filed
                    and the heart utterly corrupted, and the wretch given wholly up to the dominion
                    of foul sin, and plunged into thorough degradation. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Arvina had thought lightly, if at all, of his first luxurious sin, but now to
                    the depth of his secret soul, he felt that he was emmeshed and entangled in the
                    deepest villainy. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> All that he ever had yet heard hinted darkly or surmised of Catiline's gigantic
                    schemes of wickedness, rushed on him, all at once! He doubted nothing any
                    longer; it was clear to him as noonday; distinct and definite as if it had been
                    told to him in so many words; the treason to the state concealed by individual
                    murder; and he, a sworn accomplice—nay, a sworn slave to this murderer and
                    traitor! </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Nor was this all; his peril was no less than his guilt; equal on either
                    side—sure ruin if he should be true to his country, and scarce less sure, if he
                    should join its parricides. For, though he had not dared say so much to
                    Catiline, he had already sent the poniard to the house of Cicero, and a brief
                    letter indicating all that he had learned from Volero. This he had done in the
                    interval between the Campus and his unlucky visit to the house of Catiline, whom
                    he then little deemed to be the man of whom he was in quest. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Doubtless, ere this time, the cutler had been summoned to the consul's presence,
                    and the chief magistrate of the Republic had learned that the murderer of his
                    slave was the very person, whom he had bound himself by oaths, so strong that he
                    shuddered at the very thought of them, to support and defend to the utmost. </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> What was he then to do? how to proceed, since to recede appeared impossible? </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> How was he to account to the conspirator for his inability to produce the
                    poniard at their appointed meeting? how should he escape the pursuit of his
                    determined vengeance, if he should shun the meeting? </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And then, Lucia! The recollection, guilty and degraded as he knew her to be, of
                    her soft blandishments, of her rare beauty, of her wild and inexplicable manner,
                    adding new charms to that forbidden bliss, yet thrilled in every sense. And must
                    he give her up? No! madness was in the very thought! so strangely had she spread
                    her fascinations round him. And yet did he love her? no! perish the thought!
                    Love is a high, a holy, a pure feeling—the purest our poor fallen nature is
                    capable of experiencing; no! this fierce, desperate, guilty passion was no more
                    like true love, than the whirlwind that upheaves the tortured billows, and hurls
                    the fated vessel on the treacherous quicksands, is like to the beneficent and
                    gentle breeze that speeds it to the haven of its hopes, in peace and honor. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> After a little while consumed in anxious and uneasy thoughts, he determined—as
                    cowards of the mind determine ever—to temporise, to await events, to depend
                    upon the tide of circumstance. He would, he thought, keep the appointment with
                    his master—for such he felt that Catiline now was indeed—however he might
                    strive to conceal the fact; endeavor to learn what were his real objects; and
                    then determine what should be his own course of action. Doubtful, and weak of
                    principle, and most infirm of purpose, he shrunk alike from breaking the oath he
                    had been entrapped into taking, and from committing any crime against his
                    country. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> His country!—To the Roman, patriotism stood for religion!—Pride, habit,
                    education, honor, interest, all were combined in that word, country; and could
                    he be untrue to Rome? His better spirit cried out, no! from every nerve and
                    artery of his body. And then his evil genius whispered Lucia, and he wavered. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Meantime, had no thought crossed him of his own pure and noble Julia, deserted
                    thus and overlooked for a mere wanton? Many times! many times, that day, had his
                    mind reverted to her. When first he went to Cataline's <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> house, he went with the resolution of leaving it at an early hour, so soon as
                    the feast should be over, and seeking her, while there should yet be time to
                    ramble among the flower-beds on the hill of gardens, or perchance, to drive out
                    in his chariot, which he had ordered to be held in readiness, toward the falls
                    of the Anio, or on the proud Emilian way. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Afterward, in the whirl of his mad intoxication for the fascinating Lucia, all
                    memory of his true love was lost, as the chaste moon-light may be dimmed and
                    drowned for a while by the red glare of the torches, brandished in some
                    licentious orgy. Nor did he think of her again, till he found himself saddened,
                    and self-disgusted, plunged into peril—perhaps into ruin, by his own guilty
                    conduct; and then, when he did think, it was with remorse, and self-reproach,
                    and consciousness of disloyalty, so bitterly and keenly painful—yet
                    unaccompanied by that repentance, which steadily envisages past wrong, and
                    determines to amend in future—that he shook off the recollection, whenever it
                    returned, with wilful stubbornness; and resolved on forgetting, for the present,
                    the being whom a few short hours before, he would have deemed it impossible that
                    he should ever think of but with joy and rapturous anticipation. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Occupied in these fast succeeding moods and fancies, Paullus had made his way
                    homeward from the house of Catiline, so far as to the Cerolian place, at the
                    junction of the Sacred Way and the Carinæ. He paused here a moment; and grasping
                    his fevered brow with his hand, recalled to mind the strange occurrences, most
                    unexpected and unfortunate, which had befallen him, since he stood there that
                    morning; each singly trivial; each, unconnected as it seemed with the rest, and
                    of little moment; yet all, when united, forming a chain of circumstances by
                    which he was now fettered hand and foot—his casual interview with Catiline on
                    the hill; his subsequent encounter of Victor and Aristius Fuscus; the
                    recognition of his dagger by the stout cutler Volero; the death of Varus in the
                    hippodrome; his own victorious exercises on the plain; the invitation to the
                    feast; the sumptuous banquet; and last, alas! and most fatal, the too voluptuous
                    and seductive Lucia. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Just at this moment, the doors of Cicero's stately mansion were thrown open, and
                    a long train came sweeping <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>out in dark garments,
                    with blazing torches, and music doleful and piercing. And women chanting the
                    shrill funereal strain. And then, upon a bier covered with black, the rude
                    wooden coffin, peculiar to the slave, of the murdered Medon! Behind him followed
                    the whole household of the Consul; and last, to the extreme astonishment of
                    Paullus, preceded by his lictors, and leaning on the arm of his most faithful
                    freedman, came Cicero himself, doing unusual honor, for some cause known to
                    himself alone, to the manes of his slaughtered servant. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> As they passed on toward the Capuan gate of the city, the Consul's eyes fell
                    directly on the form of Arvina, where he stood revealed in the full glare of the
                    torch-light; and as he recognised him, he made a sign that he should join him,
                    which, under those peculiar circumstances, he felt that he could not refuse to
                    do. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Sadly and silently they swept through the splendid streets, and under the arched
                    gate, and filed along the celebrated Appian way, passing the tomb of the proud
                    Scipios on the left hand, with its superb sarcophagi—for that great house had
                    never, from time immemorial, been wont to burn their dead—and on the right, a
                    little farther on, the noble temple and the sacred slope of Mars, and the old
                    statue of the god which had once sweated blood, prescient of Thrasymene. On they
                    went, frightening the echoes of the quiet night with their wild lamentations and
                    the clapping of their hands, sending the glare of their funereal torches far and
                    wide through the cultured fields and sacred groves and rich gardens, until they
                    reached at length the pile, hard by the columbarium, or slave-burying-place of
                    Cicero's household. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Then, the rites performed duly, the dust thrice sprinkled on the body, and the
                    farewell pronounced, the corpse was laid upon the pile, and the tall spire of
                    blood-red flame went up, wavering and streaming through the night, rich with
                    perfumes, and gums, and precious ointment, so noble was the liberality of the
                    good Consul, even in the interment of his more faithful slaves. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> No words were uttered to disturb the sound of the ceremony, until the flames
                    died out, and, the smouldering embers quenched with wine, Thrasea, as the
                    nearest relative of the deceased, gathered the ashes and inurned them, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>when they were duly labelled and consigned to their
                    niche in the columbarium; and then, the final <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ilicet</span></span>
                    pronounced, the sad solemnity was ended. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Then, though not until then, did Cicero address the young man; but then, as if
                    to make up for his previous silence, he made him walk by his side all the way
                    back to the city, conversing with him eagerly about all that had passed,
                    thanking him for the note and information he had sent concerning Volero, and
                    anticipating the immediate discovery of the perpetrators of that horrid crime. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I have not had the leisure to summon Volero before me," he added. "I wished
                    also that you, Arvina, should be present when I examine him. I judge that it
                    will be best, when we shall have dismissed all these, except the lictors, to
                    visit him this very night. He is a thrifty and laborious artisan, and works
                    until late by lamp light; we will go thither, if you have naught to hinder you,
                    at once." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Arvina could do no otherwise than assent; but his heart beat violently, and he
                    could scarcely frame his words, so dreadful was his agitation. Yet, by dint of
                    immense exertion, he contrived to maintain the outward appearance of composure,
                    which he was very far from feeling, and even to keep up a connected conversation
                    as they walked along. Returning home at a much quicker pace than they had gone
                    out, it was comparatively but a short time before they arrived at the house of
                    Cicero, and there dismissed their followers, many of the slaves and freedmen of
                    Arvina having joined the procession in honour of their fellow-servant Thrasea. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Thence, reserving two lictors only of the twelve, the consul with his wonted
                    activity hurried directly forward by the Sacred Way to the arch of Fabius; and
                    then, as the young men had gone in the morning, through the Forum toward the
                    cutler's shop, taking the shortest way, and evidently well acquainted with the
                    spot beforehand. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I caused the funeral to take place this night," he said to Arvina, "instead of
                    waiting the due term of eight days, on purpose that I might create no suspicion
                    in the minds of the slayers. They never will suspect him, we have buried even
                    now, to be the man they slew last night, and will fancy, it may be, that the
                    body is not discovered even." </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "It will be well if it prove so," replied Paullus, feeling that he must say
                    something, and fearful of committing himself by many words. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "It will, and I think probably it may," answered Cicero. "But see, I was right;
                    there shines the light from Volero's shop, though all the other booths have been
                    closed long ago, and the streets are already silent. There are but few men, even
                    in this great city, of whom I know not something, beyond the mere names. Think
                    upon that, young man, and learn to do likewise; cultivate memory, above all
                    things, except virtue." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I should have thought such things too mean to occupy a place, even, in the mind
                    of Cicero," answered Arvina. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Nothing, young man, that pertains to our fellow men, is too mean to occupy the
                    mind of the noblest. Why should it, since it doth occupy the mind of the Gods,
                    who are all great and omnipotent?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "You lean not then to the creed of Epicurus, which teaches——" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Who, I?" interrupted Cicero, almost indignantly. "No! by the immortal Gods! nor
                    I trust, my young friend, do you. Believe me—but ha!" he added in a quick and
                    altered tone, "what have we here? there is some villainy in the wind—away!
                    away! there! lictors apprehend that fellow." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> For as they came within about a bow-shot of the booth of Volero, the sound of a
                    slight scuffle was heard from within, and the light of the lamp became very dim
                    and wavering, as if it had been overset; and in a moment went out altogether.
                    But its last glimmering ray shewed a tall sinewy figure making out of the door
                    and bounding at a great pace up the street toward the Carmental gate. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Arvina caught but a momentary glance of the figure; yet was that glance enough.
                    He recognized the spare but muscular form, all brawn and bone and sinew; he
                    recognized the long and pardlike bounds!—It was his tyrant, and, as he thought,
                    his Fate! </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The lictors rushed away upon his track, but there seemed little chance that,
                    encumbered with their heavy fasces, they would overtake so swift a runner, as,
                    by the momentary sight they had of him, the fugitive appeared to be. </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Arvina and the Consul speedily reached the booth. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Volero! Volero!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But there came forth no answer. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Volero! what ho! Volero!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They listened eagerly, painfully, with ears sharpened by excitement. There came
                    a sound—a plash, as of a heavy drop of water falling on the stone floor;
                    another, and another—the trickling of a continuous stream. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> All was dark as a moonless midnight. Yet Cicero took one step forward, and laid
                    his hand upon the counter. It splashed into a pool of some warm liquid. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Now may the Gods avert!" he cried, "It is blood! there has been murder here!
                    Run, my Arvina, run to Furbo's cookshop, across the way there, opposite; they
                    sit up there all night—cry murder, ho! help! murder!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A minute had scarcely passed before the heavy knocking of the young man had
                    aroused the house—the neighborhood. And at the cry of murder, many men, some
                    who had not retired for the night, and some half dressed as they had sprung up
                    from their couches, came rushing with their weapons, snatched at random, and
                    with torches in their hands. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was but too true! the laborious artizan was dead; murdered, that instant, at
                    his own counter, at his very work. He had not moved or risen from his seat, but
                    had fallen forward with his head upon the board; and from beneath the head was
                    oozing in a continuous stream the dark red blood, which had overflowed the
                    counter, and trickled down, and made the paved floor one great pool! </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ye Gods! what blood! what blood!" exclaimed the first who came in. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Poor Volero! alas!" cried Furbo, "it is not an hour since he supped on a pound
                    of sausages at my table, and now, all is over!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They raised his head. His eyes were wide open; and the whole face bore an
                    expression neither of agony or terror, so much as of wild surprise. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The throat was cut from ear to ear, dividing the windpipe, the carotid arteries
                    and jugular veins on both sides; and so strong had been the hand of the
                    assassin, and so keen the weapon, that the neck was severed quite to the back
                    bone. </p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Among the spectators was a gladiator; he whose especial task it was to cut the
                    throats of the conquered victims on the arena; he looked eagerly and curiously
                    at the wound for a moment, and then said— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "A back stroke from behind—a strong hand, and a broadbacked knife—the man has
                    been slain by a gladiator, or one who knows the gladiator's trick!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "The man," said the Consul calmly, "has been killed by an acquaintance, a
                    friend, or a familiar customer; he had not even risen from his seat to speak
                    with him; and see, the burnisher is yet grasped in his hand, with which he was
                    at work. Ha!" he exclaimed, as his lictors entered, panting and tired by their
                    fruitless chase, "could you not overtake him?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "We never saw him any more, my consul," replied both men in one breath. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Let his head down, my friend," said Cicero, turning, much disappointed as it
                    seemed, to Furbo, "let it lie, as it was when we found it; clear the shop,
                    lictors; take the names of the witnesses; one of you keep watch at the door,
                    until you are relieved; lock it and give the key to the prætor, when he shall
                    arrive; the other, go straightway, and summon Cornelius Lentulus; he is the
                    prætor for this ward. Go to your homes, my friends, and make no tumult in the
                    streets, I pray you. This shall be looked to and avenged; your Consul watches
                    over you!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Live! live the Consul! the good Consul, the man of the people!" shouted the
                    crowd, as they dispersed quietly to their homes. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Arvina, come with me. To whom told you, that you had found, and Volero sold,
                    this dagger?" he asked very sternly. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "To no one, Cicero. Marcus Aurelius Victor, and Aristius Fuscus were with me,
                    when he recognized it for his work?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No one else?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No one, save our slaves, and they," he added in a breath, "could not have heard
                    what passed." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Hath no one else seen it?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "As I was stripping for the contests on the Campus, Catiline saw it in my
                    girdle, and admired its fabric." </p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Consul, no!" But, with the word, he turned as white as marble. Had it been
                    daylight, his face had betrayed him; as it was, Cicero observed that his voice
                    trembled. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Catiline is the man!" he said solemnly, "the man who slew Medon yesternight,
                    who has slain Volero now. Catiline is the man; but this craves wary walking.
                    Young man, young man, beware! methinks you are on the verge of great danger. Get

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The sun rose clear and bright on the following morning; the air was fresh and
                    exhilarating, and full of mirthful inspiration. But Paullus Arvina rose
                    unrefreshed and languid, with his mind ill at ease; for the reaction which
                    succeeds ever to the reign of any vehement excitement, had fallen on him with
                    its depressing weight; and not that only, but keen remorse for the past, and, if
                    possible, anxiety yet keener for the future. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Disastrous dreams had beset his sleeping hours; and, at his waking, they and the
                    true occurrences of the past day, seemed all blended and confused into one
                    horrible and hideous vision. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Now he envisaged the whole dark reality of his past conduct, of his present
                    situation. Lucia, the charming siren of the previous evening, appeared in her
                    real colors, as the immodest, passionate wanton; Catiline as the monster that
                    indeed he was! </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And yet, alas! alas! as the clear perception of the truth dawned on him, it was
                    but coupled with a despairing sense, that to these he was linked inevitably and
                    forever. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The oath! the awful oath which he had sworn in the fierce whirl of passion,
                    registered by the arch-traitor—the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>oath involving,
                    not alone, his own temporal and eternal welfare, but that of all whom he loved
                    or cherished; his own pure, beautiful, inimitable Julia, to whom his heart now
                    reverted with a far deeper and more earnest tenderness, after its brief
                    inconstancy; as he compared her strong, yet maidenly and gentle love, with the
                    wild and ungovernable passions of the wanton, for whom he had once sacrificed
                    her. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Paullus Arvina was not naturally, not radically evil. Far from it, his impulses
                    were naturally virtuous and correct, his calm sober thoughts always honorable
                    and upright; but his passions were violent and unregulated; his principles of
                    conduct not definitively formed; and his mind wavering, unsettled, and unsteady. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> His passions on the previous day had betrayed him fatally, through the dark
                    machinations of the conspirator, and the strange fascinations of his lovely
                    daughter, into the perpetration of a great crime. He had bound himself, by an
                    oath too dreadful to be thought of without shuddering, to the commission of yet
                    darker crimes in future. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And now the mists of passion had ceased to bedim his mental vision, his eyes
                    were opened, that he saw and repented most sincerely the past guilt. How was he
                    to avoid the future? </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> To no man in these days, could there be a doubt even for a moment—however great
                    the sin of swearing such an oath! No one in these days, knowing and repenting of
                    the crime, would hesitate a moment, or fancy himself bound, because he had
                    committed one vile sin in pledging himself thus to guilt, to rush on deeper yet
                    into the perpetration of wickedness. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The sin were in the swearing, not in the breaking of an oath so vile and
                    shameful. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But those were days of dark heathenish superstition, and it was far beyond the
                    reach of any intellect perhaps of that day to arrive at a conclusion, simple as
                    that to which any mind would now leap, as it were instinctively. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In those days, an omitted rite, an error in the ceremonial tribute paid to the
                    marble idol, was held a deeper sin than adultery, incest, or blood shedding. And
                    the bare thought of the vengeance due for a broken oath would often times <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>keep sleepless, with mere dread, the eyes of men who
                    could have slumbered calmly on the commission of the deadliest crimes. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Such, then, was the state of Arvina's mind on that morning—grieving with deep
                    remorse for the faults of which he confessed himself guilty; trembling at the
                    idea of rushing into yet more desperate guilt; and at the same time feeling
                    bound to do so, in despite of his better thoughts, by the fatal oath which bound
                    him to the arch traitor. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> While he was sitting in his lonely chamber, with his untasted meal of ripe figs,
                    and delicate white bread, and milk and honeycomb before him, devouring his own
                    heart in his fiery anguish, and striving with all his energies of intellect to
                    devise some scheme by which he might escape the perils that seemed to hem him
                    round on every side, his faithful freedman entered, bearing a little billet, on
                    which his eye had scarcely fallen before he recognized the shapely characters of
                    Julia's well-known writing. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He broke the seal which connected the flaxen band, and with a trembling eye, and
                    a soul that feared it knew not what, from the very consciousness of guilt, he
                    read as follows: </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "A day has passed, my Paullus, and we have not met! The first day in which we
                    have not met and conversed together, since that whereon you asked me to be
                    yours! I would not willingly, my Paul, be as those miserable and most foolish
                    girls, of whom my mother has informed me, who, given up to jealousy and doubt,
                    torment themselves in vain, and alienate the noble spirits, which are bound to
                    them by claims of affection only, not of compulsion or restraint. Nor am I so
                    unreasonable as to think, that a man has no duties to perform, other than to
                    attend a woman's leisure. The Gods forbid it! for whom I love, I would see
                    great, and famous, and esteemed in the world's eyes as highly as in mine! The
                    house, it is true, is our sphere—the Forum and the Campus, the great world with
                    its toils, its strifes, and its honors, yours! All this I speak to myself often.
                    I repeated it many, many times yesterday—it ought to have satisfied me—it did
                    satisfy my reason, Paul, but it spoke not to my heart! That whispers ever, 'he
                    came not yesterday to see me! he promised, yet he came not!' and it will not be
                    answered. Are you sick, Paullus, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that you came not?
                    Surely in that case you had sent for me. Hortensia would have gone with me to
                    visit you. No! you are not sick, else most surely I had known it! Are you then
                    angry with me, or offended? Unconscious am I, dearest, of any fault against you
                    in word, thought, or deed. Yet will I humble myself, if you are indeed wroth
                    with me. Have I appeared indifferent or cold? oh! Paul, believe it not. If I
                    have not expressed the whole of my deep tenderness which is poured out all, all
                    on thee alone—my yearning and continued love, that counts the minutes when thou
                    art not near me; it is not that I cease ever to think of thee, to adore thee,
                    but that it were unmaidenly and overbold to tell thee of it. See, now, if I have
                    not done so here; and my hand trembles, and my cheek burns, and almost I expect
                    to see the pallid paper blush, to find itself the bearer of words so passionate
                    as these. But you will pardon me, and come to me forthwith, and tell me, if
                    anything, in what I have displeased thee. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "It is a lovely morning, and Hortensia has just learned from Caius Bibulus, that
                    at high noon the ambassadors of the wild Allobroges will march in with their
                    escort over the Mulvian Bridge. She wishes much to see the pomp, for we are told
                    that their stature is gigantic and their presence noble, and their garb very
                    wild, yet magnificent withal and martial. Shall we go forth and see them?
                    Hortensia will carry me in her carpentum, and you can either ride with us on
                    horseback, or if you be not over proud take our reins yourself as charioteer,
                    or, what will perhaps be the best of all, come in your own car and escort us. I
                    need not say that I wish to see you <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">now</span></span>, for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></span> I wish always. Come, then, and quickly, if you would

                    gods! ye gods! that beheld it!" and he smote his brow heavily with his hand, and
                    bit his lip, till the blood almost sprang beneath the pressure of his teeth; but
                    recovering himself in a moment, he turned to Thrasea—"Who brought this billet?
                    doth he wait?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Phædon, Hortensia's Greek boy, brought it, noble Paullus. He waits for your
                    answer in the atrium." </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Quick, then, quick, Thrasea, give me a reed and paper." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And snatching the materials he wrote hastily: </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Chance only, evil chance, most lovely Julia, and business of some weight,
                    restrained me from you most unwilling yesterday. More I shall tell you when we
                    meet—indeed all! for what can I wish to conceal from you, the better portion of
                    my soul. Need I say that I come—not, alas, on the wings of my love, or I should
                    be beside you as I write, but as quickly as the speed of horses may whirl me to
                    your presence; until then, fare you well, and confide in the fidelity of
                    Paullus." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Give it to Phædon," he said, tossing the note to Thrasea, "and say to him, 'if
                    he make not the better haste, I shall be at Hortensia's house before him.' And
                    then, hark ye, tell some of those knaves in the hall without, to make ready with
                    all speed my light chariot, and yoke the two black horses Aufidus and Acheron.
                    With all speed, mark ye! And then return, good Thrasea, for I have much to say
                    to you, before I go." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> When he was left alone, he arose from his seat, walked three or four times to
                    and fro his chamber, in anxious and uneasy thought; and then saying, "Yes! yes!
                    I will not betray him, but I will take no step in the business any farther, and
                    I will tell him so to-night. I will tell him, moreover, that Cicero has the
                    dagger, for now that Volero is slain, I see not well how it can be identified.
                    The Gods defend me from the dark ones whom I have invoked. I will not be untrue
                    to Rome, nor to Julia, any more—perish the whole earth, rather! Ay! and let us,
                    too, perish innocent, better than to live guilty!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> As he made up his mind, by a great effort, to the better course, the freedman
                    returned, and announcing that the car would be ready forthwith, inquired what
                    dress he should bring him. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> <span class="tei tei-corr">"Never</span> mind that!

                    will be scarce possible to drive bare headed. But I have work <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>for you of more importance. You know the cave of Egeria, as men
                    call it, in the valley of the Muses?"</p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Surely, my Paullus." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I know, I know; but have you ever marked the ground especially around the
                    cave—what opportunities there be for concealment, or the like?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Not carefully," he answered, "but I have noticed that there is a little gorge
                    just beyond the grotto, broken with crags and blocks of tufo, and overgrown with
                    much brushwood, and many junipers and ivy." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "That will do then, I warrant me," replied Arvina. "Now mark what I tell you,
                    Thrasea; for it may be, that my life shall depend on your acting as I direct. At
                    the fourth hour of the night, I am to meet one in the grotto, on very secret
                    business, whom I mistrust somewhat; who it is, I may not inform you; but, as I
                    think my plans will not well suit his councils, I should not be astonished were
                    he to have slaves, or even gladiators, with him to attack me—but not dreaming
                    that I suspect anything, he will not take many. Now I would have you arm all my
                    freedmen, and some half dozen of the trustiest slaves, so as to have in all a
                    dozen or fifteen, with corslets under their tunics, and boarspears, and swords.
                    You must be careful that you are not seen going thither, and you were best send
                    them out by different roads, so as to meet after nightfall. Hide yourselves
                    closely somewhere, not far from the cavern's mouth, whence you may see, unseen
                    yourselves, whatever passes. I will carry my light hunting horn; and if you hear
                    its blast rush down and surround the cave, but hurt no man, nor strike a blow
                    save in self-defence, until I bid you. Do you comprehend me?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I comprehend, and will obey you to the letter, Paullus," answered the grave
                    freedman, "but will not you be armed?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I will, my Thrasea. Leave thou a leathern hunting helmet here on the table, and
                    light scaled cuirass, which I will do on under my toga. I shall be there at the
                    fourth hour precisely; but it were well that ye should be on your posts by the
                    second hour or soon after. For it may be, he too will lay an ambuscade, and so
                    all may be discovered." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "It shall be done, most noble master." </p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And see that ye take none but trustworthy men, and that ye all are silent—<span class="tei tei-sic">to would be ruin</span>." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "As silent as the grave, my Paullus," answered the freedman. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "The car and horses are prepared, Paullus," exclaimed a slave, entering hastily. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Who goes with me to hold the reins?" asked his master. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "The boy Myron." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "It is well. Fetch me a petasus, and lay the toga in the chariot. I may want it.
                    Now, Thrasea, I rely on you! Remember—be prudent, sure, and silent." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Else may I perish ill," replied the faithful servitor, as his master, throwing
                    the broad brimmed hat carelessly on his curly locks, rushed out, as if glad to
                    seek relief from his own gloomy thoughts in the excitement of rapid motion; and,
                    scarcely pausing to observe the condition or appearance of his beautiful black
                    coursers, sprang into the low car of bronze, shaped not much differently from an
                    old fashioned arm chair with its back to the horses; seized the reins, and drove
                    rapidly away, standing erect—for the car contained no seats—with the boy Myron
                    clinging to the rail behind him. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A few minutes brought him through the Cyprian lane and the Suburra to the
                    Virbian slope, by which he gained the Viminal hill, and the Hortensian villa; at
                    the door of which, in a handsome street leading through the Quirinal gate to the
                    Flaminian way, or great northern road of Italy, stood the carpentum, drawn by a
                    pair of noble mules, awaiting its fair freight. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> This was a two-wheeled covered vehicle, set apart mostly for the use of ladies;
                    and, though without springs, was as comfortable and luxurious a carriage as the
                    art of that day could produce; nor was there one in Rome, with the exception of
                    those kept for public use in the sacred processions, that could excel that of
                    the rich and elegant Hortensia. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The pannels were beautifully painted, and the arched top or tilt supported by
                    gilded caryatides at the four corners. Its curtains and cushions were of fine
                    purple cloth; and altogether, though far less convenient, it was a much <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>gayer and more sumptuous looking vehicle than the
                    perfection of modern coach building. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The ladies were both waiting in the atrium, when the young man dismounted from
                    his car; and never had his Julia, he thought, looked more lovely than she did
                    this morning, with the redundant masses of her rich hair confined by a net of
                    green and gold, and a rich <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pallium</span></span>, or shawl of the same
                    colors, gracefully draped over her snowy stola, and indicating by the soft sweep
                    of its outlines the beauties of a figure, which it might veil but could not
                    conceal. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Joyously, in the frank openness of her pure nature, she sprung forward to meet
                    him, with both her fair hands extended, and the ingenuous blood rising faintly
                    to her pale cheeks. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Dear, dearest Paul—I am so happy, so rejoiced to see you." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Nothing could be more tender, more affectionate, than all her air, her words,
                    her manner. Love flashed from her bright eyes irrepressible, played in the
                    dimples of her smiling mouth, breathed audible in every tone of her soft silvery
                    voice. Yet was there nothing that the gravest and most rigid censor could have
                    wished otherwise—nothing that he could have pronounced, even for a moment, too
                    warm, or too free for the bearing of the chariest maiden. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The very artlessness of her emotions bore evidence to their purity, their
                    holiness. She was rejoiced to see her permitted lover, she felt no shame in that
                    emotion of chaste joy, and would no more have dreamed of concealing it from him
                    whom she loved so devotedly, than of masking her devotion to the Gods under a
                    veil of indifference or coldness. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Here was the very charm of her demeanor, as here was the difference between her
                    manner, and that of her rival Lucia. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In Julia, every thought that sprang from her heart, was uttered by her lips in
                    frank and fearless innocence; she had no thought she was ashamed of, no wish she
                    feared to utter. Her clear bright eyes dwelt unabashed and fondly on the face of
                    him she loved; and no scrutiny could have detected in their light, one glance of
                    unquiet or immodest passion. Her manner was warm and unreserved toward Paul,
                    because she had a right to love him, and cared not <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                    who knew that she did so. Lucia's was as cold as snow, on the contrary; yet it
                    required no second glance to perceive that the coldness was but the cover
                    superinduced to hide passions too warm for revelation. Her eye was downcast; yet
                    did its stolen glances speak things, the secret consciousness of which would
                    have debased the other in her own estimation beyond the hope of pardon. Her
                    tongue was guarded, and her words slow and carefully selected, for her
                    imaginations would have made the brazen face of the world blush for shame could
                    it have heard them spoken. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Hortensia smiled to witness the manifest affection of her sweet child; but the
                    smile was, she knew not why, half mournful, as she said— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "You are unwise, my Julia, to show this truant how much you prize his coming;
                    how painfully his absence depresses you. Sages declare that women should not let
                    their lords guess, even, how much they are loved." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Why, mother," replied Julia, her bright face gleaming radiantly with the pure
                    lustre of her artless spirit, "I <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">am</span></span> glad to see him; I
                        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">do</span></span> prize his coming; I <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">do</span></span> love
                    Paullus. Why, then, should I dissemble, when to do so were dishonest, and were
                    folly likewise?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "You should not tell him so, my child," replied the mother, "I fear you should
                    not tell him so. Men are not like us women, who love but the more devotedly, the
                    more fondly we are cherished. There is, I fear, something of the hunter's, of
                    the conqueror's, ardour, in their passion; the pursuit is the great allurement;
                    the winning the great rapture; and the prize, once securely won, too often cast
                    aside, and disregarded." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No! no!" returned the girl eagerly, fixing her eyes on her lover's features, as
                    if she would read therein the outward evidences of that nobility of soul, which
                    she believed to exist within. "I will not believe it; it were against all
                    gratitude! all honor! all heart-truth! No, I will not believe it; and if I did,
                    Hortensia, by all the Gods, I had rather live without love, than hold it on so
                    vile a tenure of deceit. What, treasure up the secrets of your soul from your
                    soul's lord? No! no! I would as soon conceal my devotion from the powers of
                    heaven, as my affections from their rightful master. I, for one, never will
                    believe that all men are selfish and unfaithful." </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "May the Gods grant, my Julia, that sad experience shall never teach you that
                    <span class="tei tei-corr">they</span> are so. I, at least, will believe, and pray, that, what his sex may be
                    soever, our Paullus will prove worthy ever of that best gift of God, a pure
                    woman's pure and unselfish love." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Oh! may it be so," answered Paullus, clasping his hands fervently together.
                    "May I die ere I wrong my Julia! and be you sure, sweet girl, that your simple
                    trust is philosophy far truer than the sage's lore. Base must his nature be, and
                    his heart corrupt, who remains unsubdued to artlessness and love, such as yours,
                    my Julia." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "But tell us, now," said the elder lady, "what was it that detained you, and
                    where were you all the day? We expected you till the seventh hour of the night,
                    yet you came not." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I will tell you, Hortensia," he replied; "as we drive along; for I had rather
                    do so, where there be no ears to overhear us. You must let me be your charioteer
                    to-day, and your venerable grey-headed coachman shall ride with my wild imp
                    Myron, in the car, if you will permit it." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Willingly," she replied. "Then something strange has happened. Is it not so?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I knew it," exclaimed Julia, clasping her snowy hands together, "I knew it; I
                    have read it in his eye this half hour. What can it be? it is something fearful,
                    I am certain." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Nay! nay! be not alarmed; if there were danger, it is passed already. But come,
                    let me assist you to the carriage; I will tell you all as we go. But if we do
                    not make good speed, the pomp will have passed the bridge before we reach it." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The ladies made no more delay, but took their places in the carriage, Paul
                    occupying the front seat, and guiding the sober mules with far more ease, than
                    Hortensia's aged charioteer experienced in restraining the speed of Arvina's
                    fiery coursers, and keeping them in their place, behind the heavier carpentum. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The narrow streets were now passed, and threading the deep arch of the Quirinal
                    gate, they struck into a lane skirting the base of the hill of gardens, on the
                    right hand, by which they gained the great Flaminian way, just on the farther
                    confines of the Campus; when they drove rapidly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                    toward the Milvian bridge, built a few years before by Æmilius Scaurus, and
                    esteemed for many a year the masterpiece of Roman architecture. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> As soon as they had cleared the confines of the busy city, within which the
                    throng of vehicles, and the passengers, as well on foot as on horseback,
                    compelled Arvina to give nearly the whole of his attention to the guidance of
                    the mules—he slackened the reins, and leaving the docile and well-broken
                    animals to choose their own way, giving only an occasional glance to their
                    movements, commenced the detail of his adventures at the point, where he parted
                    from them on the night before the last. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Many were the emotions of fear, and pity, and anxiety which that tale called
                    forth; and more than once the tears of Julia were evoked by sympathy, first,
                    with her lover's daring, then with the grief of Thrasea. But not a shade of
                    distrust came to cloud her pure spirit, for Paullus mentioned nothing of his
                    interview with Catiline on the Cælian, or in the Campus; much less of his dining
                    with him, or detecting in him the murderer of the hapless Volero. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Still he did not attempt to conceal, that both Cicero and himself had suspicions
                    of the identity of the double murderer, or that he was about to go forth that
                    very evening, for the purpose of attempting—as he represented it—to ascertain,
                    beyond doubt, the truth of his suspicions. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And here it was singular, that Julia evinced not so much alarm or perturbation
                    as her mother; whether it was that she underrated the danger he was like to run,
                    or overrated the prowess and valor of her lover. But so it was, for though she
                    listened eagerly while he was speaking, and gazed at him wistfully after he had
                    become silent, she said nothing. Her beautiful eyes, it is true, swam with big
                    tear-drops for a moment, and her nether lip quivered painfully; but she mastered
                    her feelings, and after a short space began to talk joyously about such subjects
                    as were suggested by the pleasant scenery, through which their road lay, or the
                    various groups of people whom they met on the way. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Ere long the shrill blast of a cavalry trumpet was heard from the direction of
                    the bridge, and a cloud of dust surging up in the distance announced the
                    approach of the train. </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> There was a small green space by the wayside, covered with short mossy turf, and
                    overshadowed by the spreading branches of a single chesnut, beneath which
                    Paullus drew up the mules of Hortensia's carriage, directing the old charioteer,
                    who seemed hard set to manage his high-bred and fiery steeds, to wheel
                    completely off the road, and hold them well in hand on the green behind him. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> By this time the procession had drawn nigh, and two mounted troopers, glittering
                    in casques of highly polished bronze, with waving crests of horsehair, corslets
                    of burnished brass, and cassocks of bright scarlet cloth, dashed by as hard as
                    their fiery Gallic steeds could trot, their harness clashing merrily from the
                    rate at which they rode. Before these men were out of sight, a troop of horse
                    rode past in serried order, five abreast, with a square crimson banner, bearing
                    in characters of gold the well-known initials, S. P. Q. R., and surmounted by a
                    gilded eagle. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Nothing could be more beautifully accurate than the ordered march and exact
                    discipline of this little band, their horses stepping proudly out, as if by one
                    common impulse, in perfect time to the occasional notes of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">lituus</span></span>, or cavalry trumpet, by which all their manœuvres were
                    directed; and the men, hardy and fine-looking figures, in the prime of life,
                    bestriding with an air of perfect mastery their fiery chargers, and bearing the
                    weight of their heavy panoply beneath the burning sunshine of the Italian noon,
                    as though a march of thirty miles were the merest child's play. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> About half a mile in the rear of this escort, so as to avoid the dust which hung
                    heavily, and was a long time subsiding in the breathless atmosphere, came the
                    train of the ambassadors from the Gaulish Highlands, and on these men were the
                    eyes of the Roman ladies fixed with undisguised wonder, not unmixed with
                    admiration. For their giant stature, strong limbs, and wild barbaric dresses,
                    were as different from those of the well-ordered legionaries, as were their long
                    light tresses, their blue eyes, keen and flashing as a falcon's, and their fair
                    ruddy skins, from the clear brown complexions, dark locks, and black eyes of the
                    Italian race. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The first of these wild people was a young warrior above six feet in height,
                    mounted on a superb grey charger, which bore his massive bulk as if it were
                    unconscious of his burthen. His large blue eyes wandered around him on all <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sides with a quick flashing glance that took in
                    everything, yet seemed surprised at nothing; though almost everything which he
                    beheld must have been strange to him. His long red hair flowed down in wavy
                    masses over his neck and shoulders, and his upper lip, though his cheeks and his
                    chin were closely shaven, was clothed with an immense moustache, the ends of
                    which curled upward nearly to his eyes. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Upon his head he wore a casque of bronze, covered with studs of silver, and
                    crested by two vast polished horns, the spoil of the fiercest animal of Europe's
                    forests—the gigantic and indomitable Urus. A coat of mail, composed of bright
                    steel rings interwoven in the Gaulish fashion, covered his body from the throat
                    downward to the hips, leaving his strong arms bare to the shoulder, though they
                    were decorated with so many chains, bracelets, and armlets, and broad rings of
                    gold and silver, as would have gone far to protect them from a sword cut. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> His legs were clothed, unlike those of any southern people, in tightly-sitting
                        pantaloons—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">braccæ</span></span>, as they were called—of gaily
                    variegated tartans, precisely similar to the trews of the Scottish Highlander—a
                    much more ancient part of the costume, by the way, than the kilt, or short
                    petticoat, now generally worn—and these trews, as well as the streaming plaid,
                    which he wore belted gracefully about his shoulders, shone resplendent with
                    checkers of the brightest scarlet, azure, and emerald, and white, interspersed
                    here and there with lines and squares of darker colors, giving relief and
                    harmony to the general effect. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A belt of leather, studded with bosses and knobs of coral and polished mountain
                    pebbles, girded his waist, and supported a large purse of some rich fur, with a
                    formidable dirk at the right side, and, at the left, suspended by gilt chains
                    from the girdle, a long, straight, cutting broadsword, with a basket hilt—the
                    genuine claymore, or great sword—to resist the sweep of which Marcellus had
                    been fain, nearly five hundred years before, to double the strength of the Roman
                    casque, and to add a fresh layer of wrought iron to the tough fabric of the
                    Roman buckler. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> This ponderous blade constituted, with the dagger, the whole of his offensive
                    armature; but there was slung on his left shoulder a small round targe, of the
                    hide of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>mountain bull, bound at the rim, and
                    studded massively with bronze, and having a steel pike projecting from the
                    centre—in all respects the same instrument as that with which the clans
                    received the British bayonet at Preston Pans and Falkirk. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The charger of this gallantly-attired chief was bedecked, like his rider, with
                    all the martial trappings of the day; his bridle, mounted with bits of ponderous
                    Spanish fabric, was covered with bosses gemmed with amber and unwrought coral;
                    his housings, of variegated plaid, were elaborately fringed with embroideries of
                    gold; and his rich scarlet poitrel was decked, in the true taste of the western
                    savage, with tufts of human hair, every tuft indicating a warrior slain, and a
                    hostile head embalmed in the coffers of the valiant rider. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "See, Julia, see," whispered Arvina, as he passed slowly by their chariot, "that
                    must be one of their great chiefs, and a man of extraordinary prowess. Look at
                    the horns of the mighty Urus on his helmet, a brute fiercer, and well nigh as
                    large as a Numidian elephant. He must have slain it, single-handed in the
                    forest, else had he not presumed to wear its trophies, which belong only to the
                    greatest of their champions. For every stud of silver on his casque of bronze he
                    must have fought in a pitched battle; and for each tuft of hair upon his
                    charger's poitrel he must have slain a foe in hand-to-hand encounter. There are
                    eighteen tufts on this side, and, I warrant me, as many on the other. Doubtless,
                    he has already stricken down thirty-six foemen." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And he numbers not himself as yet so many years! Ye Gods! what monsters,"
                    exclaimed Julia, shuddering at the idea of human hair used as a decoration. "Are
                    they not anthropophagi, the Gauls, my Paullus?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No, by the Gods! Julia," answered Arvina, laughing; "but very valiant warriors,
                    and hospitable beyond measure to those who visit their native mountains;
                    admirers, too, of women, whom they regard as almost divine, beyond all things. I
                    see that stout fellow looking wild admiration at you now, from his clear blue
                    eyes, though he would fain be thought above the reach of wonder." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Are they believers in the Gods, or Atheists, as well as barbarous?" </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "By Jupiter! neither barbarous, to speak the truth, nor Atheists; they worship
                    Mercury and Jove, Mars and Apollo, and Diana, as we do; and though their tongues
                    be something wild, and their usages seem strange to us, it cannot be denied that
                    they are a brave and noble race, and at this time good friends to the Roman
                    people. Mark that old chieftain; he is the headman of the tribe, and leader of
                    the embassy, I doubt not." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> While he was speaking, a dozen other chiefs had ridden by, accompanied by the
                    chiefs of the Roman escort, some men in the prime of life, some grizzled and
                    weather-beaten, and having the trace of many a hard-fought field in the scars
                    that defaced their sunburnt visages. But the last was an old man, with long
                    silver hair, and eyebrows and mustachios white as the snow on his native Jura;
                    the principal personage evidently of the band, for his casque was plated with
                    gold, and his shirt of mail richly gilded, and the very plaid which he wore,
                    alternately checked with scarlet, black, and gold. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He also, as he passed, turned his deep grey eye toward the little group on the
                    green, and his face lightened up, as he surveyed the athletic form and vigorous
                    proportions of the young patrician, and he leaned toward the officer, who rode
                    beside him, a high crested tribune of the tenth legion, and enquired his name
                    audibly. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The soldier, who had been nodding drowsily over his charger's neck, tired by the
                    long and dusty ride, looked up half bewildered, for he had taken no note of the
                    spectators, but as his eyes met those of Arvina, he smiled and waved his hand,
                    for they were old companions, and he laughed as he gave the required information
                    to the ancient warrior. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The gaze of the old man fell next on the lovely lineaments of Julia, and dwelt
                    there so long that the girl lowered her eyes abashed; but, when she again raised
                    them, supposing that he had passed by, she still met the firm, penetrating,
                    quiet gaze, rivetted on her face, for he had turned half round in the saddle as
                    he rode along. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A milder light came into his keen, hawk-like eye, and a benignant smile
                    illuminated his gray weather-beaten features, as he surveyed and marked the
                    ingenuous and artless beauty of her whole form and face; and he whispered <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>into the tribune's ear something that made him too
                    turn back, and wave his hand to Paul, and laugh merrily. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Now, drive us homeward, Paullus," said Hortensia, as the cohort of infantry
                    which closed the procession, marched steadily along, dusty and dark with sweat,
                    yet proud in their magnificent array, and solid in their iron discipline. "Drive
                    us homeward as quickly as you may. You will dine with us, and if you must need
                    go early to your meeting, we will not hinder you." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Gladly will I dine with you; but I must say farewell soon after the third
                    hour!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They soon arrived at the hospitable villa, and shortly afterward the pleasant
                    and social meal was served. But Paul was not himself, though the lips he loved
                    best poured forth their fluent music in his ear, and the eyes which he deemed
                    the brightest, laughed on him in their speaking fondness. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Still he was sad, silent, and abstracted, and Julia marked it all; and when he
                    rose to say farewell, just as the earliest shades of night were falling, she
                    arose too; and as she accompanied him to the door, leaning familiarly on his
                    arm, she said— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "You have not told me all, Paullus. I thought so while you were yet speaking;
                    but now I am sure of it. I will not vex you at this time with questions, but
                    will devour my anxiety and grief. But to-morrow, to-morrow, Paullus, if you love
                    me indeed, you will tell me all that disturbs you. True love has no concealment
                    from true love. Do not, I pray you, answer me; but fare you well, and good
                    fortunes follow you." </p>

                    <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left; margin-left: 8.00em">That is not so. Sir, we are your enemies.</div>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was already near the fourth hour of the Roman night, or about a quarter past
                    eight of our time, when Paullus issued from the Capuan gate, in order to keep
                    his appointment with the conspirator; and bold as he was, and fearless under
                    ordinary circumstances, it would be useless to deny that his heart beat fast and
                    anxiously under his steel cuirass, as he strode rapidly along the Appian way to
                    the place of meeting. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The sun had long since set, and the moon, which was in her last quarter, had not
                    as yet risen; so that, although the skies were perfectly clear and cloudless,
                    there was but little light by which to direct his foot-steps toward the valley
                    of the Muses, had he not been already familiar with the way. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Stepping out rapidly, for he was fearful now of being too late at the place
                    appointed, he soon passed the two branches of the beautiful and sparkling Almo,
                    wherein the priests of Cybele were wont to lave the statue of their goddess,
                    amid the din of brazen instruments and sacred song; and a little further on,
                    arrived at the cross-road where the way to Ardea, in the Latin country, branched
                    off to the right hand from the great Appian turnpike. </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> At this point there was a small temple sacred to Bacchus, and a little grove of
                    elms and plane trees overrun with vines, on which the ripe clusters consecrated
                    to the God were hanging yet, though the season of the vintage had elapsed, safe
                    from the hand of passenger or truant school-boy. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Turning around the angle of this building, Arvina entered a dim lane,
                    overshadowed by the tall trees of the grove, which wound over two or three
                    little hillocks, and then sweeping downward to the three kindred streamlets,
                    which form the sources of the Almo, followed their right bank up the valley of
                    the Muses. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Had the mind of Arvina been less agitated than it was by dark and ominous
                    forebodings, that walk had been a pleasant one, in the calm and breezeless
                    evening. The stars were shining by thousands in the deep azure sky; the constant
                    chirrup of the shrill-voiced cicala, not mute as yet, although his days of
                    tuneful life were well nigh ended, rose cheerfully above the rippling murmurs of
                    the waters, and the mysterious rustling of the herbage rejoicing to drink up the
                    copious dew; and heard by fits and starts from the thick clumps of arbutus on
                    the hills, or the thorn bushes on the water's brink, the liquid notes of the
                    nightingale gushed out, charming the ear of darkness. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> For the first half mile of his walk, the young patrician met several persons on
                    the way—two or three pairs of lovers, as they seemed, of the lower orders,
                    strolling affectionately homeward; a party of rural slaves returning from their
                    labours on some suburban farm, to their master's house; and more than one loaded
                    chariot; but beyond this all was lonely and silent, with the exception of the
                    stream, the insects, and the vocal night-bird. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> There was no sound or sight that would seem to indicate the vicinity of any
                    human being, as Arvina, passing the mouth of a small gorge or hollow scooped out
                    of the bosom of a soft green hill, paused at the arch of a low but richly
                    ornamented grotto, hollowed out of the face of the rock, and supported by a
                    vault of reticulated brick-work, decorated elegantly with reliefs of marble and
                    rich stucco. The soft green mosses and dark tendrils of the waving ivy, which
                    drooped down from the rock and curtained well nigh half the opening, rendered
                    the grotto very dark with<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in. And it was a moment or
                    two before Paullus discovered that he was alone in that secluded place, or in
                    the company only of the old marble god, who, reclining on a couch of the same
                    material at the farther end of the cave, poured forth his bright waters from an
                    inverted jar, into the clear cool basin which filled the centre of the place. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He was surprised not a little at finding himself the first at the place of
                    meeting, for he was conscious that he was behind his time; and had, indeed, come
                    somewhat late on purpose, with a view of taking his stand as if naturally during
                    the interview, between the conspirator and the cave mouth. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was not, however, altogether a matter of regret to him, that he had gained a
                    little time, for the folds of his toga required some adjustment, in order to
                    enable him to get readily at the hilt of his sword, and the mouth-piece of his
                    hunting-horn, which he carried beneath his gown. And he applied himself to that
                    purpose immediately, congratulating himself, as he did so, on the failure of his
                    first project, and thinking how much better it would be for him to stand as far
                    as possible from the entrance, so as to avoid even the few rays of dim
                    star-light, which crept in through the tangled ivy. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> This was soon done; and in accordance with his afterthought, he sat down on a
                    projecting angle of the statue's marble couch, in the inmost corner of the
                    vault, facing the door, and having the pool of the fountain interposed between
                    that and himself. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> For a few moments he sat thinking anxiously about the interview, which he
                    believed, not without cause, was likely to prove embarrassing, at least, if not
                    perilous. But, when he confessed to himself, which he was very soon compelled to
                    do, that he could shape nothing of his own course, until he should hear what
                    were the plans in which Catiline desired his cooperation; and when time fled and
                    the man came not, his mind began to wander, and to think about twenty gay and
                    pleasant subjects entirely disconnected with the purpose for which he had come
                    thither. Then he fell gradually into a sort of waking dream, or vision, as it
                    were, of wandering fancies, made up partly of the sounds which he actually heard
                    with his outward ears, though his mind took but little note of them, and partly
                    of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the occurrences in which he had been mixed up,
                    and the persons with whom he had been brought into contact within the last two
                    or three days. The gory visage of the murdered slave, the sweet and calm
                    expression of his own Julia, the truculent eyes and sneering lip of Catiline,
                    and the veiled glance and voluptuous smile of his too seductive daughter,
                    whirled still before him in a strange sort of human phantasmagoria, with the
                    deep searching look of the consul orator, the wild glare of the slaughtered
                    Volero, and the stern face, grand and proud in his last agony, of the dying
                    Varus. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In this mood he had forgotten altogether where he was, and on what purpose, when
                    a deep voice aroused him with a start, and though he had neither heard his
                    footstep, nor seen him enter, Catiline stood beside his elbow. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "What ho!" he exclaimed, "Paullus, have I detained you long in this dark
                    solitude." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Nay, I know not how long," replied the other, "for I had fallen into strange
                    thoughts, and forgotten altogether the lapse of time; but here have I been since
                    the fourth hour." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And it is now already past the fifth," said Cataline, "but come, we must make
                    up for the loss of time. Some friends of mine are waiting for us, to whom I wish
                    to introduce you, that you may become altogether one of us, and take the oaths
                    of fidelity. Give me the dagger now, and let us be going on our way." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I have it not with me, Catiline." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Have it not with you! Wherefore not? wherefore not, I say, boy?" cried the
                    conspirator, very savagely. "By all the furies in deep hell, you were better not
                    dally with me." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Because it is no longer in my possession; and therefore I could not bring it
                    with me," he replied firmly, for the threats of the other only inflamed his
                    pride, and so increased his natural courage. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "By the Gods, you brave me, then!" exclaimed Catiline; "fool! fool! beware how
                    you tamper with your fate. Speak instantly, speak out: to whom have you dared
                    give it?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "There was no daring in the matter, Catiline," he answered steadily, keeping an
                    eye on the arch-traitor's movements; "before I knew that it was yours, I sent
                    it, as I had <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>promised, to Cicero, with word that
                    Volero could tell him who was the owner of it." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ha, didst thou so?" said the other, mastering instantly his fury, in his desire
                    to make himself fully acquainted with all that had passed. "When was all this?
                    has he seen Volero, and learned the secret of him, then?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I sent it, Catiline, within an hour of the time I left the Campus yesterday." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Before coming to my house to dinner?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Before going to thy house to dinner, Sergius." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Before seducing Lucia Orestilla?" again sneered the desperate villain. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Before yielding," answered the young man, who was now growing angry, for his
                    temper was not of the meekest, "to her irresistible seduction." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ha! yielding—well! we will speak of that hereafter. Hath the consul seen
                    Volero?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "He hath seen him dead; and how dead, Catiline best knoweth." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "It was, then, thou, whom I saw in the feeble lamplight with the accursed wretch
                    that crosses my path everywhere, the dastard, drivelling dotard of Arpinum; thou
                    that despite thine oath, didst lead him to detect the man, thou hadst sworn to
                    obey, and follow! Thou! it is thou, then, that houndest mine enemies upon my
                    track! By the great Gods, I know not whether most to marvel at the sublime,
                    unrivalled folly, which could lead thee to fancy, that thou, a mere boy and
                    tyro, couldst hoodwink eyes like mine; or at the daring which could prompt thee
                    to rush headlong on thine own ruin in betraying me! Boy, thou hast but one
                    course left; to join us heart and hand; to go and renew thine oath in such
                    fashion as even thou, premeditated perjurer, wilt not presume to break, and then
                    to seal thy faith by the blood"— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Of whom?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Of this new man; this pendant consul of Arpinum." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Aye!" exclaimed Paullus, as if half tempted to accede to his proposal; "and if
                    I do so, what shall I gain thereby?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Lucia, I might say," answered Catiline, "but—seeing that possession damps
                    something at all times the fierceness of pursuit—what if I should reply, the
                    second place in Rome?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "In Rome?" </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "When we have beaten down the proud patricians to our feet, and raised the
                    conquering ensign of democratic sway upon the ramparts of the capitol; when Rome
                    and all that she contains of bright and beautiful, shall be our heritage and
                    spoil; the second place, I say, in regenerated Rome, linked, too, to everlasting
                    glory." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And the first place?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "By Mars the great avenger! dost soar so high a pitch already? ho! boy, the
                    first is mine, by right, as by daring. How say you? are you mine?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "If I say no!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Thou diest on the instant." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I think not," replied Arvina quietly, "and I do answer No." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Then perish, fool, in thy folly." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And leaping forward he dealt him a blow with a long two-edged dagger, which he
                    had held in his hand naked, during the whole discussion, in readiness for the
                    moment he anticipated; and at the same instant uttered a loud clear whistle. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> To his astonishment the blade glanced off the breast of the young man, and his
                    arm was stunned nearly to the shoulder by the unexpected resistance of the stout
                    corslet. The whistle was answered, however, the very moment it was uttered; and
                    just as he saw Paullus spring to the farther side of the cavern, and set his
                    back against the wall, unsheathing a heavy broadsword of the short Roman
                    fashion, three stout men entered the mouth of the cave, heavily armed with
                    weapons of offence, although they wore no defensive armor. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Give me a sword," shouted the fierce conspirator, furious at being foiled, and
                    perceiving that his whole enterprise depended on the young man's destruction.
                    "He is armed under his gown with a breast-plate! Give me a sword, and then set
                    on him all at once. So that will do, now, on." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Hold, Sergius Catiline," exclaimed Arvina, "hold, or by all the Gods you will
                    repent it. If you have three men at your back I have full five times three
                    within call." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Call them, then!" answered the other, making at him, "call them! think you
                    again to fool me? Ho, Geta and Arminius, get round the fountain and set on him!
                    make haste I say—kill—kill." </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And with the word he rushed at him, aiming a fierce blow at his head, while the
                    others a moment afterward charged on him from the other side. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But during the brief parley Arvina had disengaged the folds of his gown from his
                    light shoulder, and wrapped it closely about his left arm, and when Catiline
                    rushed in he parried the blow with his sword, and raising the little horn he
                    carried, to his lips, blew a long piercing call, which was answered by a loud
                    shout close at hand, and by the rush of many feet without the grotto. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Catiline was himself astonished at the unexpected aid, for he had taken the
                    words of the young patrician for a mere boast. But his men were alarmed and fell
                    back in confusion, while Paul, profiting by their hesitation, sprang with a
                    quick active bound across the basin of the fountain, and gained the cavern's
                    mouth just as his stout freedman Thrasea showed himself in the entrance with a
                    close casque and cuirass of bronze, and a boar spear in his hand, the heads and
                    weapons of several other able-bodied men appearing close behind. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> At the head of these Arvina placed himself instantly, having his late assailants
                    hemmed in by a force, against which they now could not reasonably hope to
                    struggle. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But Paullus showed no disposition to take undue advantage of his superiority,
                    for he said in a calm steady voice, "I leave you now, my friend; and it will not
                    be my fault, if aught that has passed here, is remembered any farther. None here
                    have seen you, or know who you are; and you may rest assured that for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">her</span></span> sake and mine own honor, if I join not your plans, I
                    will not betray you, or reveal your counsels. To that I am sworn, and come what
                    may, my oath shall not be broken." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Tush," cried the other, maddened by disappointment, and filled with desperate
                    apprehensions, "men trust not avowed traitors. Upon them, I say, you dogs. Let
                    there be forty of them, but four can stand abreast in the entrance, and we can
                    front them, four as good as they." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And he again dashed at Arvina, without waiting to see if his gladiators meant to
                    second his attack; but they hung back, reluctant to fight against such odds;
                    for, though brave men, and accustomed to risk their lives, without quarrel or
                    excitement, for the gratification of the brute po<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>pulace of Rome, they had come to the cave of Egeria, prepared for
                    assassination, not for battle; and their antagonists were superior to them as
                    much in accoutrement and arms—for their bronze head-pieces were seen distinctly
                    glimmering in the rays of the rising moon—as in numbers. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The blades of the leaders clashed together, and several quick blows and parries
                    had been interchanged, during which Thrasea, had he not been restrained by his
                    young master's orders, might easily have stabbed the conspirator with his
                    boar-spear. But he held back at first, waiting a fresh command, until seeing
                    that none came, and that the unknown opponent was pressing his lord hard; while
                    the gladiators, apparently encouraged by his apathy, were beginning to handle
                    their weapons, he shifted his spear in his hands, and stepping back a pace, so
                    as to give full scope to a sweeping blow, he flourished the butt, which was
                    garnished with a heavy ball of metal, round his head in a figure of eight, and
                    brought it down so heavily on the felt skull-cap of the conspirator, that his
                    teeth jarred audibly together, a quick flash sprang across his eyes, and he
                    fell, stunned and senseless, at the feet of his intended victim. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Hold, Thrasea, hold," cried Paullus, "by the Gods! you have slain him." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No, I have not. No! no! his head is too hard for that," answered the freedman;
                    "I felt my staff rebound from the bone, which it would not have done, had the
                    skull been fractured. No! he is not dead, though he deserved to die very
                    richly." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I am glad of it," replied Paullus. "I would not have him killed, for many
                    reasons. Now, hark ye, ye scoundrels and gallows-birds! most justly are your
                    lives forfeit, whether it seem good to me, to take them here this moment, or to
                    drag you away, and hand you over to the lictors of the city-prætor, as common
                    robbers and assassins." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "That you cannot do, whilst we live, most noble," answered the boldest of the
                    gladiators, sullenly; "and you cannot, I think, take our lives, without leaving
                    some of your own on our swords' points." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Brave me not," cried the young man, sternly, "lest you drive me to do that I
                    would not. Your lives, I say, are forfeit; but, seeing that I love not
                    bloodshed, I leave you, for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>this time, unpunished.
                    Take up the master whom you serve, and bear him home; and, when he shall be able
                    to receive it, tell him Paullus Arvina pardons his madness, pities his fears,
                    and betrays no man's trust—least of all his. For the rest, let him choose
                    between enmity and friendship. I care not which it be. I can defend my own life,
                    and assail none. Beware how you follow us. If you do, by all the Gods! you die.
                    See, he begins to stir. Come, Thrasea, call off your men; we will go, ere he
                    come to his senses, lest worse shall befal." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And with the words he turned his back contemptuously on the crest-fallen
                    gladiators, and strode haughtily across the threshold, leaving the fierce
                    conspirator, as he was beginning to recover his scattered senses, to the keen
                    agony of conscious villainy frustrated, and the stings of defeated pride and
                    disappointed malice. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The night was well advanced, when he reached his own house, having met no
                    interruption on the way, proud of his well-planned stratagem, elated by success,
                    and flattered by the hope that he had extricated himself by his own energy from
                    all the perils which had of late appeared so dark and difficult to shun. </p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was not till a late hour on the following day, that Catiline awoke from the
                    heavy and half lethargic slumber, which had fallen upon him after the severe and
                    stunning blow he received in the grotto of Egeria. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> His head ached fearfully, his tongue clove to his palate parched with fever, and
                    all his muscular frame was disjointed and unstrung, so violently had his nerves
                    been shattered. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> For some time after he awoke, he lay tossing to and fro, on his painful couch,
                    scarce conscious of his own identity, and utterly forgetful of the occurrences
                    of the past evening. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> By slow degrees, however, the truth began to dawn upon him, misty at first and
                    confused, until he brought to his mind fairly the attack on Arvina, and the
                    affray which ensued; with something of an indistinct consciousness that he had
                    been stricken down, and frustrated in his murderous attempt. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> As soon as the certainty of this was impressed on him, he sprang up from his
                    bed, with his wonted impetuosity, and inquired vehemently of a freedman, who sat
                    in his chamber motionless as a statue in expectation of his waking— </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "How came I home, Chærea? and at what hour of night?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Grievously wounded, Catiline; and supported in the arms of the sturdy Germans,
                    Geta and Arminius; and, for the time, it was past the eighth hour." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "The eighth hour! impossible!" cried the conspirator; "why it was but the fifth,
                    when that occurred. What said I, my good Chærea? What said the Germans? Be they
                    here now? Answer me quick, I pray you." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "There was but one word on your lips, Catiline; a constant cry for water, water,
                    so long as you were awake; and after we had given you of it, as much as you
                    would take, and you had fallen into a disturbed and feverish sleep, you still
                    muttered in your dreams, 'water!' The Germans answered nothing, though all the
                    household questioned them; and, in good truth, Catiline, it was not very long
                    that they were capable of answering, for as soon as you were in bed, they called
                    for wine, and in less than an hour were thoroughly besotted and asleep. They are
                    here yet, I think, sleeping away the fumes of their potent flagons." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Call me Arminius, hither. Hold! What is the time of <span class="tei tei-sic">day?</span>" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "The sun is high already; it must be now near the fourth hour!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "So late! you did ill, Chærea, to let me lie so long. Call me Arminius hither;
                    and send me one of the boys; or rather go yourself, Chærea, and pray Cornelius
                    Lentulus the Prætor, to visit me before he take his seat on the Puteal Libonis.
                    It is his day, I think, to take cognizance of criminal matters. Begone, and do
                    my bidding!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Within a moment the Athenian freedman, for he was of that proud though fallen
                    city, returned conducting the huge German gladiator, whose bewildered air and
                    bloodshot eyes seemed to betoken that he had not as yet recovered fully from the
                    effect of his last night's potations. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> No finer contrast could be imagined by poet or painter, than was presented by
                    those three men, each eminently striking in his own style, and characteristic of
                    his nation. The tall spare military-looking Roman, with his hawk nose and eagle
                    eye, and close shaved face and short black hair, his every attitude and look and
                    gesture full of pride <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and dominion; the versatile
                    and polished Greek, beautiful both in form and face, as a marble of Praxiteles,
                    beaming with intellect, and having every feature eloquent of poetry and
                    imagination, and something of contempt for the sterner and harder type of mind,
                    to which he and his countryman were subjugated; and last, the wild strong-limbed
                    yet stolid-looking German, glaring out with his bright blue eyes, full of a sort
                    of stupid fierceness, from the long curls of his auburn hair, a type of man in
                    his most primitive state, the hunter and the warrior of the forest, enslaved by
                    Rome's insatiate ambition. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Catiline looked at him fiercely for a moment, and then nodded his head, as if in
                    assent to some of his own meditations; then muttering to himself, "the boar! the
                    mast-fed German boar!" he turned to the Greek, saying sharply— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Art thou not gone to Lentulus? methought thou hadst been thither, and returned
                    ere this time! Yet tarry, since thou art here still. Are any of my clients in
                    the atrium—any, I mean, of the trustiest!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Rufinus, surnamed Lupus, is without, and several others. Stolo, whom you
                    preserved from infamy, when accused of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dolus malus</span></span>, in
                    the matter of assault with arms on Publius Natro, is waiting to solicit you, I
                    fancy, for some favor." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "The very man—the Wolf is the very man! and your suitor for favors cannot
                    refuse to confer what he requests. Stay my Chærea. Send Glycon to summon
                    Lentulus, and go yourself and find out what is Stolo's suit. Assure him of my
                    friendship and support; and, hark you, have him and Rufinus into an inner
                    chamber, and set bread before them and strong wine, and return to me presently.
                    Now, then, Arminius," he continued, as the Greek left the room, "what did we do
                    last night, and what befel us?—for I can remember nothing clearly." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The giant shook his tawny locks away from his brow, and gazed into his
                    employer's face with a look of stolid inquiry, and then answered— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Do! we did nothing, that I know! We followed thee as in duty bound to that cave
                    by the Almo; and when we had stayed there awhile, we brought thee back again,
                    seeing thou couldst not go alone. What can I tell? you know yourself why you
                    took us thither." </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Thou stupid brute!" retorted Catiline, "or worse than brute, rather—for brutes
                    augment not their brutishness by gluttony and wine-bibbing—thou art asleep yet!
                    see if this will awaken thee!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And with the word he snatched up a large brazen ewer full of cold water, which
                    stood on a slab near him, and hurled it at his head. The gladiator stood quite
                    still, and merely bent his neck a little to avoid the heavy vessel, which almost
                    grazed his temples, and then shook himself like a water spaniel, as the contents
                    flashed full into his face and eyes. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Do not do that again," he grunted, "unless you want to have your throat
                    squeezed." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "By Pollux the pugilist! he threatens!" exclaimed Catiline, laughing at his
                    dogged anger. "Do you not know, cut-throat, that one word of mine can have your
                    tough hide slashed with whips in the common gaol, till your very bones are
                    bare?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And do you know what difference it makes, whether my hide be slashed with
                    dog-whips in the gaol, or with broadswords in the amphitheatre? A man can only
                    die! and it were as well, in my mind, to die having killed a Roman in his own
                    house, as a countryman on the arena." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "By all the Gods!" cried Catiline, "he is a philosopher! but, look you here, my
                    German Solon, you were better regard me, and attend to what I tell you; so may
                    you escape both gaol and amphitheatre. Tell me, briefly, distinctly, and without
                    delay, what fell out last evening." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "You led us to assault that younker, whom you know; and when we would have set
                    upon him, and finished his business easily, he blew a hunting horn, and fifteen
                    or sixteen stout fellows in full armor came down the bank from behind and shut
                    up the cave's mouth—you know as well as I do." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "So far I do, most certainly," replied the conspirator, "but what then?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Why, then, thou wouldest not hear reason; but, though the youth swore he would
                    not betray thee, must needs lay on, one man against sixteen; and so, as was
                    like, gottest thine head broken by a blow of a boar-spear from a great
                    double-handed Thracian. For my part, I wondered he did not put the spear-head
                    through and through <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>you. It was a great pity that he
                    did not; it would have saved us all, and you especially, a world of trouble." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And you, cowardly dogs, forsook me; and held back, when by a bold rush we might
                    easily have slain him, and cut our way through the dastard slaves." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No! no! we could not; they were all Thracians, Dacians, and Pannonians; and
                    were completely armed, too. We might have killed him, very likely, but we could
                    never have escaped ourselves." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And he, he? what became of him when I had fallen?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "He bade us take you up," replied the German, "and carry you home, and tell you
                    'to fear nothing, he would betray no man, least of all you.' He is a fine young
                    fellow, in my judgment; for he might just as well have killed us all, as not, if
                    he had been so minded; and I can't say but that it would have served us rightly,
                    for taking odds of four to one upon a single man. That is, I know, what you
                    Romans call fighting; beyond the Rhine we style it cowardly and murder! Then,
                    after that he went off with his men, leaving us scratching our heads, and
                    looking as dastardly and crest-fallen as could be. And then we brought you home
                    hither, after it had got late enough to carry you through the streets, without
                    making an uproar; and then Lydon and Chærea put you to bed; and I, and Geta, and
                    Ardaric, as for us, we got drunk, seeing there was no more work to do last
                    night, and not knowing what might be to do, to-day. And so it is all well, very
                    well, as I see it." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Well, call you it, when he has got off unscathed, and lives to avenge himself,
                    and betray me?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "But he swore he would do neither, Catiline," answered the simple-minded son of
                    the forest. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Swore!" replied the conspirator, with a fell sneer. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ay did he, master! swore by all that was sacred he would never betray any man,
                    and you least of all; and I believe he will keep his promise." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "So do I," answered Catiline, bitterly, "I swear he shall; not for the lack of
                    will, but of means to do otherwise! You are a stupid brute, Arminius; but useful
                    in your way. I have no need of you to-day, so go and tell the butler to give you
                    wine enough to make all three of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>you drunk again;
                    but mind that ye are sound, clear-headed, and alert at day-break to-morrow." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "But will he give it to me at my bidding?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "If not, send him to me for orders; now, begone." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I ask for nothing better," replied the gladiator, and withdrew, without any
                    word or gesture of salutation, in truth, despising the Roman in his heart as
                    deeply for what he deemed his over-craftiness and over-civilization, as the more
                    polished Greek did, for what on his side he considered the utter absence of
                    both. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Scarce had the German left the room, before the Greek returned, smiling, and
                    seemingly well satisfied with the result of his mission. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Catiline looked at him steadily, and nodding his head, asked him quietly— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Are they prepared, Chærea?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "To do anything you would have them, Catiline. Stolo, it seems, is again
                    emperilled—another charge of attempt to murder—and he wants you to screen
                    him." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And so I will; and will do more. I will make him rich and great, if he do my
                    bidding. Now go, and make them understand this. They must swear that they came
                    hither this morning to claim my aid in bringing them to speech with Lentulus,
                    the Prætor, and then thou must be prepared to swear, Chærea, that I have had no
                    speech or communication with them at all—which is quite true." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "That is a pity," answered the Greek, coolly; "for any one can swear steadily to
                    the truth, but it requires genius to carry out a lie bravely." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Oh! never fear, thou shalt have lies enough to swear to! Now mark me, when
                    Lentulus comes hither, they must accuse to him Paullus Cæcilius Arvina, whose
                    person, if they know him not, you must describe to them—him who dined with me,
                    you know, the day before yesterday—of subornation to commit murder. The place
                    where he did so, the top of the Cælian hill. The time, sunrise on that same day.
                    The person whom he desired them to slay, Volero the cutler, who dwelt in the
                    Sacred Way. They must make up the tale their own way, but to these facts they
                    must swear roundly. Do you understand me?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Perfectly; they shall do it well, and both be in one tale. I will help them to
                    concoct it, and dress it up with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>little truthful
                    incidents that will tell. But are you sure that he cannot prove he was not
                    there?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Quite sure, Chærea. For he <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">was</span></span> there." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And no witnesses who can prove to whom he spoke?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Only one witness, and he will say nothing, unless called upon by Paullus." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And if so called upon?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Will most reluctantly corroborate the tale of Stolo and Rufinus!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ha! ha!" laughed the freedman, "thou shouldst have been a Greek, Catiline, thou
                    art too shrewd to be a mere Roman." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "A <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mere</span></span> Roman, hang-dog!" answered Catiline, "but thou
                    knowest thine opportunity, and profitest by it! so let it pass! Now as for thee,
                    seeing thou dost love lying, thou shalt have thy part. Thou shalt swear that the
                    night before that same morning, at a short time past midnight, thou wert
                    returning by the Wicked street, from the house of Autronius upon the Quirinal,
                    whither I sent thee to bid him to dinner the next day—he shall confirm the
                    tale—when thou didst hear a cry of murder from the Plebeian graveyard on the
                    Esquiline; and hurrying to the spot, didst see Arvina, with his freedman Thrasea
                    bearing a torch, conceal a fresh bleeding body in a broken grave; and, hidden by
                    the stem of a great tree thyself, didst hear him say, as he left the ground,
                    'That dog will tell no tales!' Thou must swear, likewise, that thou didst tell
                    me the whole affair the next morning, and that I bade thee wait for farther
                    proof ere speaking of the matter. And again, that we visited the spot where thou
                    saw'st the deed, and found the grass trampled and bloody, but could not find the
                    body. Canst thou do this, thinkest thou?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Surely I can," said the Athenian, rubbing his hands as if well pleased, "so
                    that no one shalt doubt the truth of it! And thou wilt confirm the truth?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "By chiding thee for speaking out of place. See that thou blurt it out abruptly,
                    as if unable to keep silence any longer, as soon as the others have finished
                    their tale. Begone and be speedy. Lentulus will be here anon!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The freedman withdrew silently, and Catiline was left alone in communion with
                    his own bad and bitter thoughts; and painful, as it seemed, and terrible, even
                    to himself, was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that communion, for he rose up from
                    his seat and paced the room impetuously, to and fro, gnashing and grinding his
                    teeth, and biting his lips till the blood sprang out. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> After a while, however, he mastered his passions, and began to dress himself,
                    which he did by fits and starts in a manner perfectly characteristic of the man,
                    uttering hideous imprecations if the least thing ran counter to his wishes, and
                    flinging the various articles of his attire about the chamber with almost
                    frantic violence. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> By the time he had finished dressing himself, Lentulus was announced, and
                    entered with his dignified and haughty manner, not all unmixed with an air of
                    indolence. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "All hail, my Sergius," he exclaimed, as he crossed the threshold. "What hast
                    thou of so grave importance, that thou must intercept me on my way to the
                    judgment seat? Nothing has gone wrong in our councils—ha?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Nothing that I know," answered Catiline, "but here are two of my trustiest
                    clients, Stolo and Rufinus, have been these three hours waiting for my
                    awakening, that I might gain your ear for them. They sent me word they had a
                    very heavy charge to make to you; but for my part, I have not seen them, and
                    know not what it is." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Tush! tush! man; never tell me that," replied Lentulus, with a grim smile. "Do
                    you think I will believe you have sent for me all the way hither this morning,
                    without some object of your own to serve? No! no! my friend; with whomsoever
                    that may pass, it will not go current with Cornelius Lentulus!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Just as you please," said the traitor; "you may believe me or not exactly as
                    you choose; but it is true, nevertheless, that I have neither seen the men, nor
                    spoken with them. Nor do I know at all what they want." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I would, then, you had not sent for me," answered the other. "Come, let us have
                    the knaves in. I suppose they have been robbing some one's hen-roost, and want
                    to lay the blame on some one else!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "What ho! Chærea." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And as he spoke the word, the curtain which covered the door-way was withdrawn,
                    and the keen-witted freedman made his appearance. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Admit those fellows, Stolo and Rufinus. The prætor is prepared to give them a
                    hearing." </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It would have been difficult, perhaps, to have selected from the whole
                    population of Rome at that day, a more murderous looking pair of scoundrels. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Well, sirrahs, what secrets of the state have you that weigh so ponderously on
                    your wise thoughts?" asked Lentulus, with a contemptuous sneer. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Murder, most noble Lentulus—or at least subornation thereof," answered one of
                    the ruffians. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Most natural indeed! I should have thought as much. Well, tell us in a
                    word—for it is clear that nobody has murdered either of you—whom have you
                    murdered?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "If we have murdered no one, it was not for the lack of prompting, or of bribes
                    either." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Indeed! I should have thought a moderate bribe would have arranged the matter
                    easily. But come! come! to the point! whom were ye bribed or instigated to get
                    rid of? speak! I am in haste!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "The cutler, Caius Volero!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Volero! Ha!" cried Lentulus, starting. "Indeed! indeed! that may well be. By
                    whom, then, were you urged to the deed, and when?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "<span class="tei tei-corr">Paullus</span> Cæcilius Arvina tempted us to the deed, by
                    the offer of ten thousand sesterces! We met him by appointment upon the Cælian
                    hill, at the head of the Minervium, a little before sunrise, the day before
                    yesterday." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ha!" and for a moment or two Lentulus fixed his eyes upon the ground, and
                    pondered deeply on what he had just heard. "Have ye seen Volero since?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No, Prætor." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Nor heard anything concerning him?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Nothing!" said Stolo. But he spoke with a confused air and in an undecided
                    tone, which satisfied the judge that he was speaking falsely. Rufinus
                    interposed, however, saying— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "But I have, noble Lentulus. I heard say that he <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">was</span></span>
                    murdered in his own booth, that same night!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And having heard this, you told it not to Stolo?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I never thought about it any more," answered Rufinus doggedly, seeing that he
                    had got into a scrape. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "That was unfortunate, and somewhat strange, too, seeing that you came hither
                    together to speak about the very man. Now mark me. Volero <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">was</span></span> that night murdered, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and it appears to me,
                    that you are bringing this accusation against a young patrician, in order to
                    conceal your own base handiwork in the deed. Fellows, I grievously suspect you." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Wrongfully, then, you do so," answered Stolo, who was the bolder and more ready
                    witted of the two. "Rufinus ever was a forgetful fool; and I trow I am not to be
                    brought into blame for his folly." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Well for you, if you be not brought into more than blame! Now, mark me well!
                    can you prove where you were that night of the murder, excellent Stolo?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ay! can I," answered the man boldly. "I was with stout Balatro, the fisherman,
                    helping to mend his nets until the fourth hour, and all his boys were present,
                    helping us. And then we went to a cookshop to get some supper in the ox forum,
                    and thence at the sixth hour we passed across to Lydia's house in the Cyprian
                    lane, and spent a merry hour or two carousing with her jolly girls. Will that
                    satisfy you, Lentulus?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ay, if it can be proved," returned the Prætor. "And you, Rufinus; can you also
                    show your whereabout that evening?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I can," replied the fellow, "for I was sick abed; and that my wife can show,
                    and Themison the druggist, who lives in the Sacred Way. For she went to get me
                    an emetic at the third hour; and I was vomiting all night. A poor hand should I
                    have made that night at murder." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "So far, then," replied Lentulus, "you have cleared yourselves from suspicion;
                    but your charge on Arvina needs something more of confirmation, ere I dare cite
                    a Patrician to plead to such a crime! Have you got witnesses? was any one in
                    sight, when he spoke with you on the Minervium?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "There was one; but I know not if he will choose to speak of it?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Who was it?" exclaimed Lentulus, growing a little anxious on the subject, for
                    though he cared little enough about Arvina, he was yet unwilling to see a
                    Patrician arraigned for so small a matter, as was in his eyes the murder of a
                    mechanic. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Why should he not speak? I warrant you I will find means to make him." </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "It was my patron, Lentulus." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Your patron! man!" he cried, much astonished. "What, Catiline, here?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Catiline it was! my Prætor." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And have you consulted with him, ere you spoke with me?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Not so! most noble, for he would not admit us!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Speak, Sergius. Is this so? did you behold these fellows in deep converse with
                    Cæcilius Arvina, in the Minervium? But no! it must be folly! for what should you
                    have been doing there at sunrise?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I prithee do not ask me, Lentulus," answered Catiline, with an air of well
                    feigned reluctance. "I hate law suits and judicial inquiries, and I love young
                    Arvina." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Then you did see them? Nay! nay! you must speak out. I do adjure you, Catiline,
                    by all the Gods! were you, at sunrise, on the Cælian, and did you see Arvina and
                    these two?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I was, at sunrise, on the Cælian; and I did see them." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And heard you what they said?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No! but their faces were grave and earnest; and they seemed angry as they
                    separated." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ha! In itself only, this were a little thing; but when it turns out that the
                    man <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">was</span></span> slain that same night, the thing grows serious.
                    You, therefore, I shall detain here as witnesses, and partially suspected. Some
                    of your slaves must guard them, Catiline, and I will send a lictor to cite
                    Paullus, that he appear before me after the session at the Puteal Libonis. I am
                    in haste. Farewell!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Me! me! hear me! good Lentulus—hear me!" exclaimed Chærea, springing forward,
                    all vehemence and eagerness to speak, as it would seem, ere he should be
                    interrupted. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Chærea?" cried Catiline, looking sternly at him, and shaking his finger,
                    "Remember!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No! no!" replied Chærea—"no! no! I will not hold my peace! No! Catiline, you
                    may kill me, if you choose, but I will speak; to keep this secret any longer
                    would kill me, I tell you." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "If it do not, I will," answered his master, angrily. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "This must not be, my Sergius," interposed Lentulus, "let the man speak if he
                    have any light to throw on this <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>mysterious business.
                    Say on, my good fellow, and I will be your mediator with your master." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The freedman needed no more exhortation, but poured out a flood of eager,
                    anxious narrative, as had been preconcerted between himself and Catiline,
                    speaking with so much vehemence, and displaying so much agitation in all his air
                    and gestures, that he entirely imposed his story upon Lentulus; and that
                    Catiline had much difficulty in restraining a smile at the skill of the Greek. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ha! it is very clear," said Lentulus, "he first slew the slave with his own
                    hand, and then would have compassed—nay! I should rather say, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">has</span></span> compassed—Volero's slaughter, who must some how or
                    other have become privy to the deed. I must have these detained, and him
                    arrested! There can be no doubt of his guilt, and the people will be, I think,
                    disposed to make an example; there have of late been many cases of
                    assassination!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> As soon as they were left alone, Lentulus looked steadily into the face of his
                    fellow-conspirator for a moment, and then burst into a hoarse laugh. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Why all this mummery, my Sergius?" he added, as soon as he had ceased from
                    laughing, "Or wherefore would you have mystified me too?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I might have wished to see whether the evidence was like to seem valid to the
                    Judices, from its effect upon the Prætor!" answered the other. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And are you satisfied?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I am." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "You may be so, my Sergius, for, of a truth, until Chærea swore as he did
                    touching Medon, I was myself deceived." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "You believe, then, that this will be sufficient to secure his condemnation?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Beyond doubt. He will be interdicted fire and water, if these men stick to
                    their oaths only. It would be well, perhaps, to convict one of Arvina's slaves
                    of the actual death of Volero. That might be done easily enough, but there must
                    be care taken, that you select one who shall not be able to prove any alibi. But
                    wherefore are you so bent on destroying this youth, and by the law, too, which
                    is ever both perilous and uncertain?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "He knows too much, to live without endangering others." </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "What knows he?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Who slew Medon—Who slew Volero—What we propose to do, ere long, in the
                    Campus!" answered Catiline, steadily. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "By all the Gods?" cried Lentulus, turning very pale, and remaining silent for
                    some moments. After which he said, with a thoughtful manner, "it would be better
                    to get rid of him quietly." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "That has been tried too." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Well?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "It failed! He is now on his guard. He is brave, strong, wary. It cannot be
                    done, save thus." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "He will denounce us. He will declare the whole, ere we can spring the mine
                    beneath him." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No! he will not; he dares not. He is bound by oaths which—" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Oaths!" interrupted Lentulus, with a sneer, and in tones of contemptuous
                    ridicule. "What are oaths? Did they ever bind you?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I do not recollect," answered Catiline; "perhaps they did, when I was a boy,
                    and believed in Lemures and Lamia. But Paullus Arvina is not Lucius Catiline,
                    nor yet Cornelius Lentulus; and I say that his oaths shall bind him, until—" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And I say, they shall not!" A clear high voice interrupted him, coming,
                    apparently, through the wall of the chamber. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Lentulus started—his very lips were white, and his frame shook with agitation,
                    if it were not with fear. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Catiline grew pale likewise; but it was rage, not terror, that blanched his
                    swarthy brow. He dashed his hand upon the table— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Furies of Hell!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> While the words were yet trembling on his lips, the door was thrown violently
                    open, the curtains which concealed it torn asunder, and, with her dark eyes
                    gleaming a strange fire, and two hard crimson spots gleaming high up on her
                    cheek bones—the hectic of fierce passion—her bosom throbbing, and her whole
                    frame dilated with anger and excitement, young Lucia stood before them. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And I say," she repeated, "that they shall not bind him! By all the Gods! I
                    swear it! By my own love! my own <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>dishonor! I swear
                    that they shall not! Fool! fool! did you think to outwit me? To blind a woman,
                    whose every fear and passion is an undying eye? Go to! go to! you shall not do
                    it." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Audacious, as he was, the traitor was surprised, almost daunted; and while
                    Lentulus, a little reassured, when he saw who was the interlocutor, gazed on him
                    in unmitigated wonder, he faltered out, in tones strangely dissimilar to his
                    accustomed accents of indomitable pride and decision— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "You mistake, girl; you have not heard aright, if you have heard at all; I would
                    say, you are deceived, Lucia!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Then would you lie!" she answered, "for I am not deceived, though you would
                    fain deceive me! Not heard? not heard?" she continued. "Think you the walls in
                    the house of Catiline have no eyes nor ears?" using the very words which he had
                    addressed to her lover; <span class="tei tei-corr">"Lucius</span> Catiline!
                    I know <span class="tei tei-corr">all!"</span> </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "You know all?" exclaimed Lentulus, aghast. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And will prevent all!" replied the girl, firmly, "if you dare cross my
                    purposes!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Dare! dare!" replied Catiline, who now, recovering from his momentary surprise,
                    had regained all his natural haughtiness and vigor. "Who are you, wanton, that
                    dare talk to us of daring?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Wanton!" replied the girl, turning fiery red. "Ay! But who made me the wanton
                    that I am? Who fed my youthful passions? Who sapped my youthful principles? Who
                    reared me in an atmosphere, whose very breath was luxury, voluptuousness,
                    pollution, till every drop of my wholesome blood was turned to liquid flame?
                    till every passion in my heart became a fettered earthquake? Fool! fool! you
                    thought, in your impotence of crime, to make Lucia Orestilla your instrument,
                    your slave! You have made her your mistress! You dreamed, in your insolence of
                    fancied wisdom, that, like the hunter-cat of the Persian despots, so long as you
                    fed the wanton's appetite, and basely pandered to her passions, she would leap
                    hood-winked on the prey you pointed her. Thou fool! that hast not half read thy
                    villain lesson! Thou shouldst have known that the very cat, thou thoughtest me,
                    will turn and rend the huntsman if he dare rob her of her portion! I tell you,
                    Lucius Catiline, you thought me a mere wanton! a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                    mere sensual thing! a soulless animal voluptuary! Fool! I say, double fool! Look
                    into thine own heart; remember what blood runs in these female veins! Man!
                    Father! Vitiator! My spirit is not female! my blood, my passions, my contempt of
                    peril, my will indomitable and immutable, are, like my mortal body, your
                    begetting! My crimes, and my corruption, are your teaching! Beware then, as you
                    know the heat of your own appetites, how you presume to hinder mine! Beware, as
                    you know your own recklessness in doing and contempt in suffering, how you stir
                    me, your child, to do and suffer likewise! Beware, as you know the extent of
                    your own crimes, the depth of your own pollution, how you drive me, your pupil,
                    to out-do her master! Beware! I say! beware! This man is mine. Harm but one hair
                    upon his head, and you shall die, like a dog, with the dogs who snarl at your
                    bidding, and your name perish with you. I have spoken!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> There needed not one tenth part of the wisdom, which the arch-traitor really
                    possessed, to shew him how much he had miscalculated the range of his daughter's
                    intellect; the fierce energies of her powerful but misdirected mind. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He felt, for a moment, as the daring archimage whose spells, too potent for
                    their master's safety, have evoked and unchained a spirit that defies their
                    guidance. But, like that archimage, conscious that all depends on the exertion
                    of his wonted empire, he struggled hard to regain his lost authority. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Girl," he replied, in those firm deep tones of grave authority, which he deemed
                    the best calculated to control her excitement, "You are mad! Mad, and
                    ungrateful; and like a frantic dog would turn and rend the hand that feeds you,
                    for a shadow. I never thought of making you an instrument; fool indeed had I
                    been, to think I could hoodwink such an intellect as yours! If I have striven to
                    clear away the mists of prejudice from before your eyes, which, in your
                    senseless anger, you now call corrupting you, it was because I saw in you a
                    kindred spirit to mine own, capable to soar fearless and undazzled into the very
                    noon of reason. If I have taught you to indulge your passions, opened a universe
                    of pleasures to your ken, it was that I saw in you a woman of mind so manly,
                    that all the weaknesses, which fools call affections, would be but <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>powerless to warp it from its purpose. I would have

                    to brave me thus, whom never man yet braved and lived to boast of it! And now
                    for a mere girlish fancy, a weak feminine caprice for a man, who cares not for
                    you; who has betrayed you; who, idiot and inconsistent that he is, fresh from
                    your fiery kisses, was whimpering within an hour at the feet of his cold Julia;
                    who has, I doubt not, boasted of your favors, while he deplored his own
                    infatuation, to her, his promised wife!—For a fond frivolous liking of a
                    moment, you would forego gratification, rank, greatness, power, and vengeance!
                    Is this just toward me, wise toward yourself? Is this like Lucia Orestilla? You
                    would preserve a traitor who deserts you, nay, scorns you in his easy triumph!
                    You would destroy all those who love you; you would destroy yourself, to make
                    the traitor and his minion happy! Awake! awake, my Lucia, from this soft foolish
                    fancy! Awake, and be yourself once more! Awake to wisdom, to ambition, to
                    revenge!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> His words were spirited and fiery; but they struck on no kindred chord in the
                    bosom of his daughter. On the contrary, the spark had faded from her eye and the
                    flush from her cheek, and her looks were dispirited and downcast. But as he
                    ceased, she raised her eye and met his piercing gaze firmly, and replied in a
                    sorrowful yet resolute tone. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Eloquent! aye! you are eloquent! Catiline, would I had never learned it to my
                    cost; but it is too late now! it is all too late! for the rest, I am awake; and
                    so far, at least, am wise, that I perceive the folly of the past, and decipher
                    clearly the sophistry of your false teaching. As for the future, hope is dead,
                    and ambition. Revenge, I seek not; if I did so, thou art there, on whom to wreak
                    it; for saving thou, and myself only, none have wronged me. More words are
                    needless. See that thou lay aside thy plans, and dare not to harm him, or her.
                    He shall not betray thee or thine; for that will I be his surety and hostage!
                    Injure them, by deed or by word, and, one and all, you perish! I ask no promise
                    of you—promises bind you <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>not!—but let fear bind

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Can this be Lucia Orestilla?" exclaimed Catiline, "this puling love-sick girl,
                    this timorous, repentant—I had nearly called thee—maiden! Why, thou fool, what
                    would'st thou with the man farther? Dost think to be his wife?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Wife!" cried the wretched girl, clasping her hands together, and looking
                    piteously in her destroyer's face. "Wife! wife! and me!—alas! alas! that holy,
                    that dear, honored name!—Never! never for me the sweet sacred rites! Never for
                    me the pure chaste kiss, the seat by the happy hearth, the loving children at
                    the knee, the proud approving smile of—Oh! ye gods! ye just gods!—a loved and
                    loving husband!—Wife! wife!" she continued, lashing herself, as she proceeded,
                    into fresh anger; "there is not in the gaols of Rome the slave so base as to
                    call Lucia Orestilla wife! And wherefore, wherefore not?—Man! man! if that thou
                    be a man, and not a demon, but for thee, and thy cursed teachings, I might have
                    known all this—pure bliss, and conscious rectitude, and the respect and love of
                    men. I might have been the happy bride of an honorable suitor, the cherished
                    matron of a respected lord, the proud glad mother of children, that should not
                    have blushed to be sprung from the wanton Lucia! Thou! it is thou, thou only
                    that hast done all this!—And why, I say, why should I not revenge? Beware!
                    tempt me no farther! Do my bidding! Thou slave, that thought'st but now to be
                    the master, obey my bidding to the letter!" And she stamped her foot on the
                    ground, with the imperious air of a despotic queen. And in truth, crest-fallen
                    and heavy in spirit, were the proud men whom she so superbly threatened. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> She gazed at them contemptuously for a moment, and then, shaking her fore finger
                    menacingly, "I leave ye," she said, "I leave ye, but imagine not, that I read
                    not your councils. Me, you cannot deceive. With yourselves only it remains to
                    succeed or to perish. For if ye dare to disobey me, the gods themselves shall
                    not preserve you from my vengeance!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I fear you not, my girl," cried Catiline, "for all that you are now mad with
                    disappointment, and with anger. So you may go, and listen if you will," he
                    added, pointing to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the secret aperture concealed in
                    the mouldings of the wall. "We shall not speak the less freely for your hearing
                    us." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "There is no need to listen now," she answered, "for I know everything already." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Every thing that we <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">have</span></span> said, Lucia." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Everything that you <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></span> do, Sergius Catiline!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Aye?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Aye! and everything that I shall do, likewise!" and with the word she left the
                    room. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "A perilous girl, by all the Gods!" said Lentulus, in Greek, as she disappeared.
                    "Will she do as she threatens?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Tush!" replied Catiline in Latin, "she speaks Greek like an Athenian. I am not
                    sure, however, that she could understand such jargon as that is. No! she will do
                    none of that. She is the cleverest and best girl living, only a little
                    passionate, for which I love her all the more dearly. No! she will do none of
                    that. Because she will not be alive, to do it, this time to-morrow," he added,
                    putting his mouth within half an inch of the ear of Lentulus, and speaking in
                    the lowest whisper. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Lentulus, bold as he was and unscrupulous, started in horror at his words, and
                    his lips were white as he faltered—"Your own daughter, Lucius!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ha! ha!" laughed the fierce conspirator, aloud; "ha! ha! yes, she is my own
                    daughter, in everything but beauty. She is the loveliest creature in all Rome!
                    But we must yield, I suppose, to her wishes; the women rule us, after all is
                    said, and I suppose I was alarmed needlessly. Doubtless Arvina will be silent.
                    Come, I will walk with you so far on your way to the Forum. What ho! Chærea, see
                    that Rufinus and Stolo lack nothing. I will speak with them, when I return home;
                    and hark you in your ear. Suffer not Lucia Orestilla to leave the house a
                    moment; use force if it be needed; but it will not. Tell her it is my orders,
                    and watch her very closely. Come, Lentulus, it is drawing toward noon." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They left the house without more words, and walked side by side in silence for
                    some distance, when Catiline said in a low voice, "This is unpleasant, and may
                    be dangerous. We must, however, trust to fortune till to-morrow, when my house
                    shall be void of this pest. Then will we proceed, as we had proposed." </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Lentulus looked at him doubtfully, and asked, with a quick shudder running
                    through his limbs, as he spoke: "And will you really?—" and there he paused,
                    unable to complete the question. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Remove her?" added Catiline, completing the sentence which he had left
                    unfinished, "Ay! will I. Just as I would a serpent from my path!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And that done, what is to follow?" Lentulus inquired, with an assumption of
                    coolness, which in truth he did not feel. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "We will get rid of Arvina. And then, as it wants but four days of the
                    elections, we may keep all things quiet till the time." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Be it so!" answered the other. "When do we meet again to settle these things
                    finally?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "To-morrow, at the house of Læca, at the sixth hour of night." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Will all be there?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "All the most faithful; until then, farewell!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Farewell." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And they parted; Lentulus hurrying to the Forum, to take his seat on the
                    prætor's chair, and there preside in judgment—fit magistrate!—on men, the
                    guiltiest of whom were pure as the spotless snow, when compared with his own
                    conscious guilt; and Catiline to glide through dark streets, visiting
                    discontented artizans, debauched mechanics, desperate gamblers, scattering dark
                    and ambiguous promises, and stirring up that worthless rabble—who, with all to
                    gain and nothing to lose by civil strife and tumult, abound in all great
                    cities—to violence and thirst of blood. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Three or four hours at least he spent thus; and well satisfied with his
                    progress, delighted by the increasing turbulence of the fierce and irresponsible
                    democracy, and rejoicing in having gained many new and fitting converts to his
                    creed, he returned homeward, ripe for fresh villainy. Chærea met him on the
                    threshold, with his face pale and haggard from excitement. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Catiline," he exclaimed, "she had gone forth already, before you bade me watch
                    her!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "She!—Who, slave? who?" and knowing perfectly who was meant, yet hoping, in his
                    desperation, that he heard not aright, he caught the freedman by the throat, and
                    shook him furiously. </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Lucia Orestilla," faltered the trembling menial. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And has not returned?" thundered the traitor. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Catiline, no!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Liar! and fool!" cried the other, gnashing his teeth with rage, as he gave way
                    to his ungovernable fury, and hurling him with all his might against the marble
                    door-post. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The freedman fell, like a dead man, with the blood gushing from his nose and
                    mouth; and Catiline, striding across the prostrate body, retired sullenly and
                    slowly to muse on the disappointment of this his most atrocious project, in the
                    darkness and solitude of his own private chamber whither none dared intrude
                    unsummoned. </p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Paullus Arvina sat alone in a small chamber of his own house. Books were before
                    him, his favorites; the authors, whose words struck chords the most kindred in
                    his soul; but though his eye rested on the fair manuscripts, it was evident that
                    his mind was absent. The slender preparations for the first Roman meal were
                    displayed temptingly on a board, not far from his elbow; but they were all
                    untouched. His hair was dishevelled; his face pale, either from watching or
                    excitement; and his eye wild and haggard. He wore a loose morning gown of
                    colored linen, and his bare feet were thrust carelessly into unmatched slippers. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was past noon already; nor, though his favorite freedman Thrasea had warned
                    him several times of the lateness of the hour, had he shewn the least
                    willingness to exert himself, so far even as to dress his hair, or put on attire
                    befitting the business of the day. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It could not but be seen, at a glance, that he was ill at ease; and in truth he
                    was much perturbed by what had passed on the preceding night, and very anxious
                    with regard to the future. </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a name="Pg167" id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Nor was it without ample cause that he was restless and disturbed; within the
                    last three days he had by his own instability of purpose, and vacillating tastes
                    and temper brought himself down from as enviable a position as well can be
                    imagined, to one as insecure, unfortunate, and perilous. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> That he had made to himself in Catiline an enemy, as deadly, as persevering, as
                    relentless as any man could have upon his track; an enemy against whom force and
                    fraud would most likely be proved equally unavailing, he entertained no doubt.
                    But brave as he was, and fearless, both by principle and practice, he cared less
                    for this, even while he confessed to himself, that he must be on his guard now
                    alway against both open violence and secret murder, than he did for the bitter
                    feeling, that he was distrusted; that he had brought himself into suspicion and
                    ill-odor with the great man, in whose eyes he would have given so much to stand
                    fairly, and whose good-will, and good opinion, but two little days before, he
                    flattered himself that he had conciliated by his manly conduct. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Again, when he thought of Julia, there was no balm to his heart, no unction to
                    his wounded conscience! What if she knew not, nor suspected anything of his
                    disloyalty, did not he know it, feel it in every nerve? Did he not read tacit
                    reproaches in every beam of her deep tranquil eye? Did he not fancy some
                    allusion to it, in every tone of her low sweet voice? Did he not tremble at
                    every air of heaven, lest it should waft the rumor of his infidelity to the
                    chaste ears of her, whom alone he loved and honored? Did he not know that one
                    whisper of that disgraceful truth would break off, and forever, the dear hopes,
                    on which all his future happiness depended? And was it not most possible, most
                    probable, that any moment might reveal to her the fatal tidings?—The rage of
                    Catiline, frustrated in his foul designs, the revengeful jealousy of Lucia, the
                    vigilance of the distrustful consul, might each or all at any moment bring to
                    light that which he would have given all but life to bury in oblivion. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> For a long time he had sat musing deeply on the perils of his false position,
                    but though he had taxed every energy, and strained every faculty to devise some
                    means by which to extricate himself from the toils, into which he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>had so blindly rushed, he could think of no scheme,
                    resolve upon no course of action, which should set him at liberty, as he had
                    been before his unlucky interview with the conspirator. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> At times he dreamed of casting himself at the feet of Cicero, and confessing to
                    that great and generous statesman all his temptations, all his trials, all his
                    errors; of linking himself heart and soul with the determined patriots, who were
                    prepared to live or die with the constitution, and the liberties of the
                    republic; but the oath!—the awful imprecation, by which he had bound himself,
                    by which he had devoted all that he loved to the Infernal Gods, recurred to his
                    mind, and shook it with an earth-quake's power. And he, the bold free thinker,
                    the daring and unflinching soldier, bound hand and foot by a silly superstition,
                    trembled—aye, trembled, and confessed to his secret soul that there was one
                    thing which he ought to do, yet dared not! </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Anon, maddened by the apparent hopelessness of ever being able to recur to the
                    straight road; of ever more regaining his own self-esteem, or the respect of
                    virtuous citizens—forced, as he seemed to be, to play a neutral part—the
                    meanest of all parts—in the impending struggle—of ever gaining eminence or
                    fame under the banners of the commonwealth; he dreamed of giving himself up, as
                    fate appeared to have given him already up, to the designs of Catiline! He
                    pictured to himself rank, station, power, wealth, to be won under the ensigns of
                    revolt; and asked himself, as many a self-deluded slave of passion has asked
                    himself before, if eminence, however won, be not glory; if success in the
                    world's eyes be not fame, and rectitude and excellence. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But patriotism, the old Roman virtue, clear and undying in the hardest and most
                    corrupt hearts, roused itself in him to do battle with the juggling fiends
                    tempting him to his ruin; and whenever patriotism half-defeated appeared to
                    yield the ground, the image of his Julia—his Julia, never to be won by any
                    indirection, never to be deceived by any sophistry, never to be deluded into
                    smiling for one moment on a traitor—rose clear and palpable before him and the
                    mists were dispersed instantly, and the foes of his better judgment scattered to
                    the winds and routed. </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Thus wavering, he sat, infirm of purpose, ungoverned—whence indeed all his
                    errors—by any principle or unity of action; when suddenly the sound of a faint
                    and hesitating knock of the bronze ring on the outer door reached his ear. The
                    chamber, which he occupied, was far removed from the vestibule, divided from it
                    by the whole length of the atrium, and fauces; yet so still was the interior of
                    the house, and so inordinately sharpened was his sense of hearing by anxiety and
                    apprehension, that he recognized the sound instantly, and started to his feet,
                    fearing he knew not what. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The footsteps of the slave, though he hurried to undo the door, seemed to the
                    eager listener as slow as the pace of the dull tortoise; and the short pause,
                    which followed after the door had been opened, he fancied to be an hour in
                    duration. Long as he thought it, however, it was too short to enable him to
                    conquer his agitation, or to control the tumultuous beating of his heart, which
                    increased to such a degree, as he heard the freedman ushering the new comer
                    toward the room in which he was sitting, that he grew very faint, and turned as
                    pale as ashes. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Had he been asked what it was that he apprehended, he could assuredly have
                    assigned no reasonable cause to his tremors. Yet this man was as brave, as
                    elastic in temperament, as tried steel. Oppose him to any definite and real
                    peril, not a nerve in his frame would quiver; yet here he was, by imaginary
                    terrors, and the disquietude of an uneasy conscience, reduced to more than
                    woman's weakness. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The door was opened, and Thrasea appeared alone upon the threshold, with a
                    mysterious expression on his blunt features. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "How now?" asked Paullus, "what is this?—Did I not tell you, that I would not
                    be disturbed this morning?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Yes! master," answered the sturdy freedman; "but she said that it was a matter
                    of great moment, and that she would—" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">She!</span></span>—Who?" exclaimed Arvina, starting up from the
                    chair, which he had resumed as his servant entered. "Whom do you mean by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">She</span></span>?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "The girl who waits in the tablinum, to know if you will receive her." </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "The girl!—what girl? do you know her?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No, master, she is very tall, and slender, yet round withal and beautifully
                    formed. Her steps are as light as the doe's upon the Hæmus, and as graceful. She
                    has the finest foot and ancle mine eyes ever looked upon. I am sure too that her
                    face is beautiful, though she is closely wrapped in a long white veil. Her
                    voice, though exquisitely sweet and gentle, is full of a strange command, half
                    proud and half persuasive. I could not, for my life, resist her bidding." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Well! well! admit her, though I would fain be spared the trouble. I doubt not
                    it is some soft votary of Flora; and I am not in the vein for such dalliance
                    now." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No! Paullus, no! it is a Patrician lady. I will wager my freedom on it,
                    although she is dressed plainly, and, as I told you, closely veiled." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Not Julia? by the Gods! it is not Julia Serena?" exclaimed the young man, in
                    tones of inquiry, blent with wonder. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But, as he spoke, the door was opened once more; and the veiled figure entered,
                    realizing by her appearance all the good freedman's eulogies. It seemed that she
                    had overheard the last words of Arvina; for, without raising her veil, she said
                    in a soft low voice, full of melancholy pathos, </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Alas! no, Paullus, it is not your Julia. But it is one, who has perhaps some
                    claim to your attention; and who, at all events, will not detain you long, on
                    matters most important to yourself. I have intruded thus, fearing you were about
                    to deny me; because that which I have to say will brook no denial." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The freedman had withdrawn abruptly the very moment that the lady entered; and,
                    closing the door firmly behind him, stood on guard out of earshot, lest any one
                    should break upon his young lord's privacy. But Paullus knew not this; scarce
                    knew, indeed, that they were alone; when, as she ceased, he made two steps
                    forward, exclaiming in a piercing voice— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ye Gods! ye Gods! Lucia Orestilla!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Aye! Paul," replied the girl, raising her veil, and showing her beautiful face,
                    no longer burning with bright amorous blushes, her large soft eyes, no longer
                    beaming <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>unchaste invitation, but pale, and quiet,
                    and suffused with tender sadness, "it is indeed Lucia. But wherefore this
                    surprise, I might say this terror? You were not, I remember, so averse, the last
                    time we were alone together." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Her voice was steady, and her whole manner perfectly composed, as she addressed
                    him. There was neither reproach nor irony in her tones, nor anything that
                    betokened even the sense of injury endured. Yet was Arvina more unmanned by her
                    serene and tranquil bearing, than he would have been by the most violent
                    reproaches. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Alas! alas! what shall I say to you," he faltered, "Lucia; Lucia, whom I dare
                    not call mine." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Say nothing, Paullus Arvina," she replied, "thou art a noble and generous
                    soul?—Say nothing, for I know what thou would'st say. I have said it to myself
                    many times already. Oh! wo is me! too late! too late! But I have come hither,
                    now, upon a brief and a pleasant errand. For it <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></span>
                    pleasant, let them scoff who will! I say, it <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></span> pleasant
                    to do right, let what may come of it. Would God, that I had always thought so!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Would God, indeed!" answered the young man, "then had we not both been
                    wretched." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Wretched! aye! most, most wretched!" cried the girl, a large bright tear
                    standing in either eye. "And art thou wretched, Paullus." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Utterly wretched!" he said, with a deep groan, and buried his face for a moment
                    in his hands. "Even before I looked upon you, thought of you, I was miserable!
                    and now, now—words cannot paint my anguish, my self-degradation!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Aye! is it so?" she said, a faint sad smile flitting across her pallid lips.
                    "Why I should feel abased and self-degraded, I can well comprehend. I, who have
                    fallen from the high estate, the purity, the wealth, the consciousness of chaste
                    and virtuous maidenhood! I, the despised, the castaway, the fallen! But thou,
                    thou!—from thee I looked but for reproaches—the just reproaches I have earned
                    by my faithless folly! I thought, indeed, to have found you wretched, writhing
                    in the dark bonds which I, most miserable, cast around you; and cursing her who
                    fettered you!" </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Cursing myself," he answered, "rather. Cursing my own insane and selfish
                    passion, which alone trammelled me, which alone ruined one, better and brighter
                    fifty fold than I!—alas! alas! Lucia." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And forgetful of all that he had heard to her disparagement from her bad
                    father's lips, or, if he half remembered discrediting all in that moment of
                    excitement, he flung himself at her feet, and grovelled like a crushed worm on
                    the floor, in the degrading consciousness of guilt. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Arise, arise for shame, young Arvina!" she said. "The ground, at a woman's
                    feet, is no place for a man ever; least of all <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">such</span></span> a
                    woman's. Arise, and mark me, when I tell you that, which to tell you, only, I
                    came hither. Arise, I say, and make me not scorn the man, whom I admire,
                    whom—wo is me! I love." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Paullus regained his feet slowly, and abashed; it seemed that all the pride and
                    haughtiness of his character had given way at once. Mute and humiliated, he sank
                    into a chair, while she continued standing erect and self-sustained before him
                    by conscious, though new, rectitude of purpose. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Mark me, I say, Arvina, when I tell you, that you are as free as air from the
                    oath, with which I bound you. That wicked vow compels you only so long as I hold
                    you pledged to its performance. Lo! it is nothing any more—for I, to whom alone
                    of mortals you are bound, now and forever release you. The Gods, above and
                    below, whom you called to witness it, are witnesses no more against you. For I
                    annul it here; I give you back your plight. It is as though it never had been
                    spoken!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Indeed? indeed? am I free?—Good, noble, generous, dear, Lucia, is it true? can

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "But wherefore," added the young man, "have you done this? You said you would

                    say 'you are free, Paullus,' almost before the breath is cold upon my lips that

                    present, and past, and forever. But what else, I beseech you, is consistent, or
                    here or anywhere, that you should dream of finding me, a weak wild wanton girl,
                    of firmer stuff than heroes? Are you, even in your own imagination, are you, I

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> She spoke eagerly, perhaps wildly; for the very part of self-denial, which she
                    was playing, stirred her mind to its lowest depths; and the great change, which
                    had been going on within for many hours, and was still in powerful progress,
                    excited her fancy, and kindled all her strongest feelings; and, as is not
                    unfrequently the case, all the profound vague thoughts, which had so long lain
                    mute and dormant, found light at once, and eloquent expression. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Paullus gazed at her, in astonishment, almost in awe. Could this be the sensual,
                    passionate voluptuary he had known two days since?—the strange, unprincipled,
                    impulsive being, who yielded like the reed, to every gust of passion—this deep,
                    clear, vigorous thinker! It was indeed a change to puzzle sager heads than that
                    of Arvina! a transformation, sudden and beautiful as that from the torpid earthy
                    grub, to the swift-winged etherial butterfly! He gazed at her, until she smiled
                    in reply to his look of bewilderment; and then he met her smile with a sad heavy
                    sigh, and answered— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Most inconsistent, I! alas! that I should say it, far worse than inconsistent,
                    most false to truth and virtue, most recreant to honor! Have not I, whose most

                    was athirst for knowledge and for truth, have not I bound myself by the most
                    dire and dreadful oaths, to find my good in evil, my truth in a lie, my glory in
                    black infamy?—Have not I, loving another better than my own life, won thee to
                    love, poor Lucia, and won thee by base falsehood to thy ruin?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No! no!" she interrupted him, "this last thing you have not done, Arvina.
                    Awake! you shall deceive yourself no longer! Of this last wrong you are as
                    innocent as the unspotted snow; and I, I only, own the guilt, as I shall bear
                    the punishment! Hear first, why I release you from your oath; and then, if you
                        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>care to listen to a sad tale, you shall know by
                    what infamy of others, one, who might else have been both innocent and happy,
                    has been made infamous and foul and vile, and wretched; a thing hateful to
                    herself, and loathsome to the world; a being with but one hope left, to expiate
                    her many crimes by one act of virtue, and then to die! to die young, very young,
                    unwept, unhonored, friendless, and an orphan—aye! from her very birth, more
                    than an orphan!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Say on," replied the young man, "say on, Lucia; and would to heaven you could
                    convince me that I have not wronged you. Say on, then; first, if you will, why
                    you have released me; but above all, speak of yourself—speak freely, and oh! if
                    I can aid, or protect, or comfort you, believe me I will do it at my life's
                    utmost peril." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I do believe you, Paullus. I did believe that, ere you spoke it. First, then, I
                    set you free—and free you are henceforth, forever." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "But wherefore?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Because you are betrayed. Because I know all that fell out last night. Because
                    I know darker villainy plotted against you, yet to come; villainy from which,
                    tramelled by this oath, no earthly power can save you. Because, I know not
                    altogether why or how, my mind has been changed of late completely, and I will
                    lend myself no more to projects, which I loathe, and infamy which I abhor.
                    Because—because—because, in a word, I love you Paullus! Better than all I
                    have, or hope to have on earth." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "But you must not," he replied, gravely yet tenderly, "because"—— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "You love another," she interrupted him, very quickly, "You love Julia Serena,
                    Hortensia's lovely daughter; and she loves you, and you are to be wedded soon.
                    You see," she added, with a faint painful smile, "that I know everything about
                    you. I knew it long since; long, long before I gave myself to you; even before I
                    loved you, Paul—for I have loved you, also, long!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Loved me long!" he exclaimed, in astonishment, "how can that be, when you never
                    saw me until the day before yesterday?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Oh! yes I have," she answered sadly. "I have seen you and known you many years;
                    though you have forgot<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ten me, if even, which I doubt,
                    you ever noticed me at all. But I can bring it to your mind. Have you forgotten
                    how, six summers since, as you were riding down the Collis Hortulorum, you
                    passed a little girl weeping by the wayside?—" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Over a wounded kid? No, I remember very well. A great country boor had hurt it
                    with a stone." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And you," exclaimed the girl, with her eyes flashing fire, "you sprang down
                    from your horse, and chastised him, till he whined like a beaten hound, though
                    he was twice as big as you were; and then you bound up the kid's wound, and
                    wiped away the tears—innocent tears they were—of the little girl, and parted
                    her hair, and kissed her on the forehead. That little girl was I, and I have
                    kept that kiss upon my brow, aye, and in my heart too! until now. No lips of man
                    or woman have ever touched that spot which your lips hallowed. From that day
                    forth I have loved you, I have adored you, Paullus. From that day forth I have
                    watched all your ways, unseen and unsuspected. I have seen you do fifty kind,
                    and generous, and gallant actions; but never saw you do one base, or tyrannous,
                    or cowardly, or cruel—" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Until that fatal night!" he said, with a deep groan. "May the Gods pardon me! I
                    never shall forgive my self." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No! no! I tell you, no!" cried the girl, impetuously. "I tell you, that I was
                    not deceived, if I fell; but I did not fall then! I knew that you loved Julia,
                    years ago. I knew that I never could be yours in honor; and that put fire and
                    madness in my brain, and despair in my heart. And my home was a hell, and those
                    who should have been my guides and saviours were my destroyers; and I am—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">what I am</span></span>; but in that you had no share. On that night, I
                    but obeyed the accursed bidding of the blackest and most atrocious monster that
                    pollutes Jove's pure air by his breath!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Bidding," he exclaimed, starting back in horror, "Catiline's bidding?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "My father's," answered the miserable girl. "My own father's bidding!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ye gods! ye <span class="tei tei-corr">gods!</span> His own daughter's purity!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Purity!" she replied, with a smile of sad bitter <span class="tei tei-corr">irony.</span>

                    house with Catiline and Orestilla? Paullus Arvina, the scenes I have beheld, the
                    orgies I have shared, the atmosphere of voluptuous sin I have breathed, almost
                    from my cradle, had changed the cold heart of the virgin huntress into the fiery
                    pulses of the wanton Venus! Since I was ten years old, I have been, wo is me!
                    familiar with all luxury, all infamy, all degradation!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Great Nemesis!" he cried, turning up his indignant eyes toward heaven. "But, in
                    the name of all the Gods! wherefore, wherefore? Even to the worst, the most
                    debased of wretches, their children's honor is still dear." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Nothing is dear to Catiline but riot, and debauchery, and murder! Sin, for its
                    own sake, even more than for the rewards its offers to its votaries! Paullus,
                    men called me beautiful! But what cared I for beauty, that charmed all but him,
                    whom alone I desired to fascinate? Men called me beautiful, I say! and in my
                    father's sight that beauty became precious, when he foresaw that it might prove
                    a means of winning followers to his accursed cause! Then was I educated in all
                    arts, all graces, all accomplishments that might enhance my charms; and, as
                    those fatal charms could avail him nothing, so long as purity remained or
                    virtue, I was taught, ah! too easily! to esteem pleasure the sole good, passion
                    the only guide! Taught thus, by my own parents! Curses, curses, and shame upon
                    them! Pity me, pity me, Paullus. Oh! you are bound to pity me! for had I not
                    loved you, fatally, desperately loved, and known that I could not win you,
                    perchance—perchance I had not fallen. Oh! pity me, and pardon——" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Pardon you, Lucia," he interrupted her. "What have you done to me, or who am I,
                    that you should crave my pardon?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "What have I done? Do you ask in mockery? Have not I made you the partaker of my

                    foul conspiracy? Betrayed you, a bound slave, to the monster—the

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Arvina groaned aloud, but made no answer, so deeply did his own thoughts
                    afflict, so terribly did her strong words oppress him. </p>

                    of others, shall be to them a door whereby they shall escape his treason, and
                    his ruin. You are saved, my Arvina! By all the Gods! you are saved! And, if it
                    lost me once, it has preserved me now—my wild, unchangeable, and undying love
                    for you, alone of men! For it has made me think! Has quenched the insane flames
                    that burned within me! Has given me new views, new principles, new hopes! Evil

                    yesternight have slain you by the gladiator's sword; discovered how he now would
                    slay you, by the perverted sword of Justice, as Medon's, as Volero's murderer;
                    convicting you of his own crimes, as he hath many men before, by his suborned
                    and perjured clients—his comrades on the Prætor's chair! I tell you, I
                    discovered but just now, that me too he will cut off in the flower of my youth;
                    in the heat of the passions, he fomented; in the rankness of the soft sins, he
                    taught me—cut me off—me, his own ruined and polluted child—by the same
                    poisoned chalice, which made his house clear for my wretched mother's nuptials!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Can these things be," cried Paullus, "and the Gods yet withhold their thunder?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Sometimes I think," the girl answered wildly, "that there are <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">no</span></span> Gods, Paullus. Do you believe in Mars and Venus?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "In Gods, whose worship were adultery and murder?" said Arvina. "Not I, indeed,
                    poor Lucia." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "If these be Gods, there is no truth, no meaning in the name of virtue. If not
                    these, what is God?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "All things!" replied the young man solemnly. "Whatever moves, whatever <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></span>, is God. The universe is but the body, that clothes
                    his eternal spirit; the winds are his breath; the sunshine is his smile; the
                    gentle dews are the tears of his compassion! Time is the creature of his hand,
                    eternity his dwelling place, virtue his law, his oracles the soul of every
                    living man!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Beautiful," cried the girl. "Beautiful, if it were but true!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "It is true—as true, as the sun in heaven; as certain as his course through the

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "How? how?" she asked eagerly. "What makes it certain?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "The certainty of death!" he answered. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ah! death, death! that is a mystery indeed. And after that—" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Everlasting life!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ha! do you believe that too? They tell me all that is a fable, a folly, and a

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ha! I will read him; I will read Plato." </p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "You shall. Mark me, then judge." And rapidly, concisely, clearly, she revealed
                    to him the dread secret. She concealed nothing, neither the ends of the
                    conspiracy, nor the names of the conspirators. She asseverated to him the
                    appalling fact, that half the noblest, eldest families of Rome, were either
                    active members of the plot, sworn to spare no man, or secret well-wishers,
                    content at first to remain neutral, and then to share the spoils of empire.
                    According to her shewing, the Curii, the Portii, the Syllæ, the Cethegi, the
                    great Cornelian house, the Vargunteii, the Autronii, and the Longini, were all
                    for the most part implicated, although some branches of the Portian and
                    Cornelian houses had not been yet approached by the seducers. Crassus, she told
                    him too, the richest citizen of Rome, and Caius Julius Cæsar, the most popular,
                    awaited but the first success to join the parricides of the Republic. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He listened thoughtfully, earnestly, until she had finished her narration, and
                    then shook his head doubtfully. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I think," he said, "you must be deceived, poor Lucia. I do not see how these
                    things can be. These men, whom you have named, are all of the first houses of
                    the state; have all of them, either themselves or their forefathers, bled for
                    the commonwealth. How then should they now wish to destroy it? They are men,
                    too, of all parties and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>all factions; the Syllæ, the
                    proudest and haughtiest aristocrats of Rome. Your father, also, belonged to the
                    Dictator's faction, while the Cornelii and the Curii have belonged ever to the
                    tribunes' party. How should this be? or how should those whose pride, whose
                    interest, whose power alike, rest on the maintenance of their order, desire to
                    mow down the Patrician houses, like grass beneath the scythe, and give their
                    honors to the rabble? How, above all, should Crassus, whose estate is worth
                    seven thousand talents,<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href="#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a> consisting, too, of buildings in the heart of
                    Rome, join with a party whose watch-words are fire and plunder, partition of
                    estates, and death to the rich? You see yourself that these things cannot be;
                    that they are not consistent. You must have been deceived by their insolent and
                    drunken boasting!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Consistent!" she replied, with vehement and angry irony. "Still harping on
                    consistency! Are virtuous men then consistent, that you expect vicious men to be
                    so? Oh, the false wisdom, the false pride of man! You tell me these things
                    cannot be—perhaps they cannot; but they <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">are!</span></span> I know
                    it—I have heard, seen, partaken all! But if you can be convinced only by seeing
                    that the plans of men, whose every action is insanity and frenzy, are wise and
                    reasonable, perish yourself in your blindness, and let Rome perish with you! I
                    can no more. Farewell! I leave you to your madness!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Hold! hold!" he cried, moved greatly by her vehemence, "are you indeed so sure
                    of this? What, in the name of all the Gods, can be their motive?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Sure! sure!" she answered scornfully; "I thought I was speaking to a capable
                    and clever man of action; I see that it is a mere dreamer, to whose waking
                    senses I appeal vainly. If <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></span> be not sure, also, you
                    must be weaker than I can conceive. Why, if there was no plot, would Catiline
                    have slaughtered Medon, lest it should be revealed? Why would he, else, have
                    striven to bind you by oaths; and to what, if not to schemes of sacrilege and
                    treason? Why would he else have murdered Volero? why planted ambushes against
                    your life? why would he now meditate my death, his own child's death, that I am
                    forced <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to fly his house? Oh! in the wide world there
                    is no such folly, as that of the over wise! Motive—motive enough have they!
                    While the Patrician senate, and the Patrician Consuls hold with firm hands the
                    government, full well they know, that in vain violence or fraud may strive to
                    wrest it from them. Let but the people hold the reins of empire, and the first
                    smooth-tongued, slippery demagogue, the first bloody, conquering soldier, grasps
                    them, and is the King, Dictator, Emperor, of Rome! Never yet in the history of
                    nations, has despotism sprung out of oligarchic sway! Never yet has democracy
                    but yielded to the first despot's usurpation! <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">They</span></span> have
                    not read in vain the annals of past ages, if you have done so, Paullus." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ha!" he exclaimed, "look they so far ahead? Ambition, then, it is but a new
                    form of ambition?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Will you denounce them, Paullus?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "At least, I will warn the Consul!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "You must denounce them, or he will credit nothing." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I will save Rome." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Enough! enough! I am avenged, and thou shalt be happy. Go to the Consul,
                    straightway! make your own terms, ask office, rank, wealth, power. He will grant

                    Arvina, fare you well forever! And sometimes, when you are happy in the chaste
                    arms of Julia, sometimes think, Paullus, of poor, unhappy, loving, lost, lost
                    Lucia!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Whither, by all the Gods, I adjure you! whither would you go, Lucia?" </p>

                    solitude, where I may die when my time comes, in peace and innocence. In Rome I
                    were not safe an hour!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Tell me where! tell me Lucia, how I may aid, how guard, console, or counsel
                    you." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "You can do none of these things, Paullus. All is arranged for the best. Within
                    an hour I shall be journeying hence, never to pass the gates, to hear the
                    turbulent roar, to breathe the smoky skies, to taste the maddening pleasures, of
                    glorious, guilty Rome! There is but one thing you can do, which will minister to
                    my well-being—but one boon you can grant me. Will you?" </p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Will you swear?" she inquired, with a faint melancholy smile. "Nay! it concerns
                    no one but myself. You may swear safely." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I do, by the God of faith!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Never seek, then, by word or deed, to learn whither I have gone, or where I
                    dwell. Look! I am armed," and she drew out a dagger as she spoke. "If I am
                    tracked or followed, whether by friend or foe, this will free me from
                    persecution; and it shall do so, by the living lights of heaven! This, after
                    all, is the one true, the last friend of the wretched. All hail to thee, healer
                    of all intolerable anguish!" and she kissed the bright blade, before she
                    consigned it to the sheath; and then, stretching out both hands to Paullus, she
                    cried, "You have sworn—Remember!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And you promise me," he replied, "that, if at any time you need a friend, a
                    defender, one who would lay down life itself to aid you, you will call on me,
                    wheresoever I may be, fearless and undoubting. For, from the festive board, or
                    the nuptial bed, from the most sacred altar of the Gods, or from the solemn
                    funeral pyre, I will come instant to thy bidding. 'Lucia needs Paullus,' shall
                    be words shriller than the war-trumpet's summons to my conscious soul." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I promise you," she said, "willingly, most willingly. And now kiss me, Paullus.
                    Julia herself would not forbid this last, sad, pious kiss! Not my lips! not my
                    lips! Part my hair on my brows, and kiss me on the forehead, where your lips,
                    years ago, shed freshness, and hope that has not yet died all away. Sweet,
                    sweet! it is pure and sweet, it allays the fierce burning of my brain. Fare you
                    well, Paul, and remember—remember Lucia Orestilla." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> She withdrew herself from his arm modestly, as she spoke, lowered her veil,
                    turned, and was gone. Many a day and week elapsed, and weeks were merged in
                    months, ere any one, who knew her, again saw Catiline's unhappy, guilty
                    daughter. </p>

                    full view of the latter noble thoroughfare. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was already fast growing dark, and the natural obscurity of the hour was
                    increased by the thickness of the lowering clouds, which overspread the whole
                    firmament of heaven, and seemed to portend a tempest. But from the jaws of the
                    semicircular arch of Roman brick, within which the group was collected, a broad
                    and wavering sheet of light was projected far into the street, and over the
                    fronts of the buildings opposite, rising and falling in obedience to the blast
                    of the huge bellows, which might be heard groaning and laboring within. The
                    whole interior of the roomy vault was filled with a lurid crimson light,
                    diversified at times by a brighter and more vivid glare as a column of living
                    flame would shoot up from the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>embers, or long trains
                    of radiant sparks leap from the bounding anvil. Against this clear back ground
                    the moving figures of the strong limbed grimy giants, who plied their mighty
                    sledges with incessant zeal on the red hot metal, were defined sharply and
                    picturesquely; while alternately red lights and heavy shadows flickered across
                    the forms and features of many other men, who stood around watching the progress
                    of the work, and occasionally speaking rapidly, and with a good deal of
                    gesticulation, at intervals when the preponderant din of hammers ceased, and
                    permitted conversation to be carried on audibly. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> At this moment, however, there was no such pause; for the embers in the furnace
                    were at a white heat, and flashes of lambent flame were leaping out of the
                    chimney top, and vanishing in the dark clouds overhead. A dozen bars of glowing
                    steel had been drawn simultaneously from the charcoal, and thrice as many
                    massive hammers were forging them into the rude shapes of weapons on the anvils,
                    which, notwithstanding their vast weight, appeared to leap and reel, under the
                    blows that were rained upon them faster than hail in winter. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But high above the roar of the blazing chimney, above the din of the groaning
                    stithy, high pealed the notes of a wild Alcaic ode, to which, chaunted by the
                    stentorian voices of the powerful mechanics, the clanging sledges made a stormy
                    but appropriate music. "Strike, strike the iron," thus echoed the stirring
                    strain, </p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The wild strain ceased, and with it the clang of the hammers, the bars of steel
                    being already beaten into the form of those short massive two-edged blades,
                    which were the Roman's national and all victorious weapon. But, as it ceased, a
                    deep stern hum of approbation followed, elicited probably by some real or
                    fancied similitude between the imagery of the song, and the circumstances of the
                    auditors, who were to a man of the lowest order of plebeians, taught from their
                    cradles to regard the nobles, and perhaps with too much cause, as their natural
                    enemies and oppres<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>sors. When the brief applause was
                    at an end, one of the elder bystanders addressed the principal workman, at the
                    forge, in a low voice. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "You are incautious, Caius Crispus, to sing such songs as this, and at such a
                    time, too." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Tush, Bassus," answered the other, "it is you who are too timid. What harm is
                    there, I should like to know, in singing an old Greek song done into Latin
                    words? I like the rumbling measure, for my part; it suits well with the clash
                    and clang of our rude trade. For the song, there is no offence in it; and, for
                    the time, it is a very good time; and, to poor men like us, a better time is
                    coming!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Oh! well said. May it be so!" exclaimed several voices in reply to the stout
                    smith's sharp words. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But the old man was not so easily satisfied, for he answered at once. "If any of
                    the nobles heard it, they would soon find offence in it, my Caius!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Oh! the nobles—the nobles, and the Fathers! I am tired of hearing of the
                    nobles. For my part, I do not see what makes them noble. Are they a whit
                    stronger, or braver, or better man than I, or Marcus here, or any of us? I trow
                    not." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Wiser—they are at least wiser, Caius," said the old man once more, "in this,
                    if in nothing else, that they keep their own councils, and stand by their own
                    order." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Aye! in oppressing the poor!" replied a new speaker. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Right, Marcus," said a second; "let them wrangle as much as they may with one
                    another, for their dice, their women, or their wine; in this at least they all
                    agree, in trampling down the poor." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "There is a good time coming," replied the smith; "and it is very near at hand.
                    Now, Niger," he continued, addressing one of his workmen, "carry these blades
                    down to the lower workshop; let Rufus fit them instantly with horn handles; and
                    then, see you to their grinding! Never heed polishing them very much, but give
                    them right keen edges, and good stabbing points." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I do not know," answered the other man to the first part of the smith's speech.
                    "I am not so sure of that." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "You don't know what I mean," said Crispus, scornfully. </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Yes. I do—right well. But I am not so confident, as you are, in these new
                    leaders." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The smith looked at him keenly for a moment, and then said significantly, "<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">do</span></span> you know?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Aye! do I," said the other; and, a moment afterward, when the eyes of the
                    bystanders were not directly fixed on him, he drew his hand edgewise across his
                    throat, with the action of one severing the windpipe. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Caius Crispus nodded assent, but made a gesture of caution, glancing his eye
                    toward one or two of the company, and whispering a moment afterward, "I am not
                    sure of those fellows." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I see, I see; but they shall learn nothing from what I say." Then raising his
                    voice, he added, "what I mean, Caius, is simply this, that I have no so very
                    great faith in the promises of this Sergius Catiline, even if he should be
                    elected. He was a sworn friend to Sylla, the people's worst enemy; and never had
                    one associate of the old Marian party. Believe me, he only wants our aid to set
                    himself up on the horse of state authority; and when he is firm in the saddle,
                    he will ride us down under the hoofs of patrician tyranny, as hard as any Cato,
                    or Pompey, of them all." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Six or seven of the foremost group, immediately about the anvil when this
                    discourse was going on, interchanged quick glances, as the man used the word
                    elected, on which he laid a strong and singular emphasis, and nodded slightly,
                    as indicating that they understood his more secret meaning. All, however, except
                    Crispus, the owner of the forge, seemed to be moved by what he advanced; and the
                    foreman of the anvil, after musing for a moment, as he leaned on his heavy
                    sledge, said, "I believe you are right; no one but a Plebeian can truly mean
                    well, or be truly fitted for a leader to Plebeians." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "You are no wiser than Crispus," interposed the old man, who had spoken first,
                    in a low angry whisper. "Do you want to discourage these fellows from rising to
                    the cry, when it shall be set up? If this be all that you can do, it were as
                    well to close the forge at once." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Which I shall do forthwith," said Caius Crispus; "for I have got through my
                    work and my lads are weary; but do not you go away, my gossips; nor you either,"
                    he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>added, speaking to the man whom he had at first
                    suspected, "tarry you, under one pretext or other; we will have a cup of wine,
                    as soon as I have got rid of these fellows. Here, Aulus," turning to his
                    foreman, "take some coin out of my purse, there it hangs by my clean tunic in
                    the corner, and go round to the wine shop, and bring thence a skinful of the
                    best Sabine vintage; and some of you bar up the door, all but the little wicket.
                    And now, my friends, good night; it is very late, and I am going to shut up the
                    shop. Good night; and remember that the only hope of us working men lies in the
                    election of Catiline tomorrow. Be in the Campus early, with all your friends;
                    and hark ye, you were best take your knives under your tunics, lest the proud
                    nobles should attempt to drive us from the ballot." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "We will, we will!" exclaimed several voices. "We will not be cozened out of our
                    votes, or bullied out of them either. But how is this? do not you vote in your
                    class?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I vote <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">with</span></span> my class! with my fellow Plebeians and
                    mechanics, I would say! What if I be one of the armorers of the first class,
                    think you that I will vote with the proud senators and insolent knights? No,
                    brethren, not one of us, nor of the carpenters either, nor of the trumpeters, or
                    horn-blowers! Plebeians we are, and Plebeians we will vote! and let me tell you
                    to look sharp to me, on the Campus; and whatever I do, so do ye. Be sure that
                    good will come of it to the people!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "We will, we will!" responded all his hearers, now unanimous. "Brave heart!
                    stout Caius Crispus! We will have you a tribune one of these days! but good
                    night, good night!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And, with the words, all left the forge, except the smith and his peculiar
                    workmen, and two or three others, all clients of the Prætor Lentulus, and all in
                    some degree associates in the conspiracy. None of them, however, were initiated
                    fully, except Caius himself, his foreman, Aulus, the aged Bassus, and the
                    stranger; who, though unknown to any one present, had given satisfactory
                    evidence that he was privy to the most atrocious portions of the plot. The wine
                    was introduced immediately, and after a deep draught, circulated more than once,
                    the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>conversation was resumed by the initiated, who
                    were now left alone. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And do you believe," said the stranger, addressing Caius Crispus, "that
                    Catiline and his companions have any real view to the redress of grievances, the
                    regeneration of the state, or the equalization of conditions?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Not in the least, I," answered the swordsmith. "Do you?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I did once." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I never did." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Then, in the name of all the Gods, why did you join with them?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Because by the ruin of the great and noble, the poor must be gainers. Because I
                    owe what I can never pay. Because I lust for what I can never win—luxury,
                    beauty, wealth, and power! And if there come a civil strife, with proscription,
                    confiscation, massacre, it shall go hard with Caius Crispus, if he achieve not
                    greatness!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And you," said the man, turning short round, without replying to the smith, and
                    addressing the aged Bassus, "why did you join the plotters, you who are so
                    crafty, so sagacious, and yet so earnest in the cause?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Because I have wrongs to avenge," answered the old man fiercely; a fiery flush
                    crimsoning his sallow face, and his eye beaming lurid rage. "Wrongs, to repay
                    which all the blood that flows in patrician veins were but too small a price!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ha?" said the other, in a tone half meditative and half questioning, but in
                    truth thinking little of the speaker, and reflecting only on the personal nature
                    of the motives, which seemed to instigate them all. "Ha, is it indeed so?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Man," cried the old conspirator, springing forward and catching him by the arm.
                    "Have you a wife, a child, a sister? If so, listen! you can understand me! I am,
                    as you see old, very old! I have scars, also, all in front; honorable scars, of
                    wounds inflicted by the Moorish assagays, of Jugurtha's desert horsemen—by the
                    huge broad swords of the Teutones and Cimbri. My son, my only son fell, as an
                    eagle-bearer, in the front rank of the hastati of the brave tenth legion—for we
                    had wealth in those days, and both fought and voted in the centuries of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>first class. But our fields were uncultivated, while
                    we were shedding our best blood for the state; and to complete the ruin, my
                    rural slaves broke loose, and joined Spartacus the gladiator. Taken, they died
                    upon the cross; and I was quite undone. Law suits and usury ate up the rest;
                    and, for these eight years past, old Bassus has been penniless, and often cold,
                    and always hungry. But if this had been all, it is a soldier's part to bear cold
                    and hunger—but not to bear disgrace. Man, there have been gyves on these
                    legs—the whip has scarred these shoulders! Ye great Gods! the whip! for what
                    have the poor to do with their Portian or Valerian laws? Nor was this all—the
                    eagle-bearer left a child, a sweet, fair, gentle girl, the image of my gallant
                    boy, the only solace of my famishing old age. I told you she was fair—fatally
                    fair—too fair for a plebeian's daughter, a plebeian's wife! Her beauty caught
                    the lustful eyes, inflamed the brutal heart of a patrician, one of the great
                    Cornelii. It is enough! She was torn from my house, dishonored, and sent home,
                    to die by her own hand, that would not pardon that involuntary sin! She died;
                    the censors heard the tale; and scoffed at the teller of it! and that Cornelius
                    yet sits in the senate; those censors who approved his guilt yet live—I say <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">live</span></span>! Is not that cause enough why I should join the
                    plotters?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I cannot answer, No!" replied the other; "and you, Aulus, what is your reason?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I would win me a noble paramour. Hortensia's Julia is very soft and beautiful." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The stranger looked at him steadily for a moment, and an expression of disgust
                    and horror crept over his bold face. "Alas!" he said at length, speaking, it
                    would seem, to himself rather than to the others, "poor Rome! unhappy country!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But, as he spoke, the strong smith, whose suspicion would seem to have been
                    excited, stepped forward and laid his hand upon the stranger's shoulder. "Look
                    you," he said, "master. None of us know you here, I think, and we should all of
                    us be glad to know, both who you are, and, if indeed you be of the faction,
                    wherefore <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></span> joined it, that you so closely scrutinize
                    our motives." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Because I was a fool, Caius Crispus; because I believed that, for a great
                    stake, Romans might yet forget <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">self</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>base and sordid <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">self</span></span>, and act as becomes
                    patriots and men! Because I dreamed, smith, till morning light came back, and I
                    awakened, and—" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And the dream!" asked the smith eagerly, grasping the handle of his heavy
                    hammer firmly, and setting his teeth hard. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Had vanished," replied the other calmly, and looking him full in the eye. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Bar the door, Aulus," cried the smith, hastily. "This fellow must die here, or
                    he will betray us," and he caught him by the throat, as he spoke, with an iron
                    grip, to prevent him from calling out or giving the alarm. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But the stranger, though not to be compared in bulk or muscular proportions with
                    the gigantic artizan, shook off his grasp with contemptuous ease, and answered
                    with a scornful smile, </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Betray you!—tush, I am Fulvius Flaccus." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Had a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of the smith, he could not have recoiled
                    with wilder wonder. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "What, Fulvius Flaccus, to whose great wrongs all injuries endured by us are but
                    as flea-bites! Fulvius, the grandson of that Fulvius Flaccus, who—" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Was murdered by Opimius, while striving for the liberties of Romans. But what
                    is this! By Mars and Quirinus! there is something afoot without!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And, as he uttered the words, he sprang to the wicket, which Aulus had not
                    fastened, and gazed out earnestly into the darkness, through which the regular
                    and steady tramp of men, advancing in ordered files, could now be heard
                    distinctly. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The others were beside him in an instant, with terror and amazement on their
                    faces. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They had not long to wait, before the cause of their alarm became visible. It
                    was a band of some five hundred stout young men of the upper classes, well armed
                    with swords and the oblong bucklers of the legion, though wearing neither casque
                    nor cuirass, led by a curule ædile, who was accompanied by ten or twelve of the
                    equestrian order, completely armed, and preceded by his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">apparitores</span></span> or beadles, and half a dozen torch-bearers. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> These men passed swiftly on, in treble file, marching as fast as they could down
                    the Sacred Way, until they reach<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ed the intersection
                    of the street of Apollo; by which they proceeded straight up the ascent of the
                    Palatine, whereon they were soon lost to view, among the splendid edifices that
                    covered its slope and summit. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "By all the Gods!" cried Caius Crispus, "This is exceedingly strange! An armed
                    guard at this time of night!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Hist! here is something more." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And, as old Bassus spoke, Antonius, the consul, who was supposed to be attached
                    to the faction of Catiline, came down a bye-street, from the lower end of the
                    Carinæ, preceded by his torch-bearers, and followed by a lictor<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href="#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a> with his
                    fasces. He was in full dress too, as one of the presiding magistrates of the
                    senate, and bore in his hand his ivory sceptre, surmounted by an eagle. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> As soon as he had passed the door of the forge, Crispus stepped out into the
                    street, motioning his guests to follow him, and desiring his foreman to lock the
                    door. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Let us follow the Consul, at a distance," he exclaimed, "my Bassus; for, as our
                    Fulvius says, there is assuredly something afoot; and it may be that it shall be
                    well for us to know it: Come, let us follow quickly." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They hurried onward, as he proposed; and keeping some twenty or thirty paces in
                    the rear of the Consul's train, soon reached the foot of the street of Apollo.
                    At this point, however, Antonius paused with his lictor; for, in the opposite
                    direction coming up from the Cerolian place toward the Forum, another line of
                    torches might be seen flaming through the darkness, and, even at that distance,
                    the axe heads of the lictors were visible, as they flashed out by fits in the
                    red torch-light. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "By all the Gods!" whispered Bassus, "it is the other consul, the new man from
                    Arpinum. Believe me, my friends, this bodes no good to us! The Senate must have
                    been convoked suddenly—and lo! here come the fathers. Look, look! this is stern
                    Cato." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And, almost as he said the words, a powerfully made and very noble looking man
                    passed so near as to brush the person of the mechanic with the folds of his
                    toga. His face, which was strongly marked, was stern certainly; but it was with
                    the sternness of gravity and deep <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>thought, coupled
                    perhaps with something of melancholy—for it might be that he despaired at times
                    of man's condition in this world, and of his prospects in the next—not of
                    austerity or pride. His garb was plain in the extreme, and, although his tunic
                    displayed the broad crimson facings, and his robe the passmenting of senatorial
                    rank, both were of the commonest materials, and the narrowest and most simple
                    cut. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Hail, noble Cato!" said the mechanic, as the senator passed by; but his voice
                    faltered as he spoke, and there was something hollow and heartless in the tones,
                    which conveyed the greeting. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Cato raised his eyes, which had been fixed on the ground in meditation, and
                    perused the features of the speaker with a severe and scrutinizing gaze; and
                    then, shaking his head sternly, as if dissatisfied with the result of his
                    observation, "This is no time of night, sirrah smith," he said, "for thee, or
                    such as thou, to be abroad. Thy daily work done, thou shouldst be at home with
                    thy wife and children, not seeking profligate adventures, or breeding foul
                    sedition in the streets. Go home! go home! for shame on thee! thou art known and
                    marked." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And the severe and virtuous noble strode onward, unattended he by any
                    torch-bearer, or freedman, and soon joined his worthy friend, the great Latin
                    orator, who had come up, and having united his train to that of the other
                    consul, was moving up the Palatine. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In the meantime senator after senator arrived, some alone, with their slaves or
                    freedmen lighting them along the streets; others in groups of two or three, all
                    hurrying toward the Palatine. The smith and his friends, who had been at first
                    the sole spectators of the shew, were now every moment joined by more and more
                    of the rabble, until a great concourse was assembled; through which the nobles
                    had some difficulty in forcing their way toward the Temple of Apollo, in which
                    their order was assembling, wherefore as yet they knew not. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> At first the crowd was orderly enough, and quiet; but gradually beginning to
                    ferment and grow warm, as it were by the closeness of its packing, cheers were
                    heard, and loud acclamations, as any member of the popular faction made his way
                    through it; and groans and yells and even <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>curses
                    succeeded, as any of the leaders of the aristocratic party strove to part its
                    reluctant masses. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And now a louder burst of acclamations, than any which had yet been heard, rang
                    through the streets, causing the very roofs to tremble. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "What foolery have we here?" said the smith very sullenly, who, though he
                    responded nothing to it, had by no means recovered from the rebuke of <span class="tei tei-corr">Cato.</span> "Oh! yes! I see, I see," and he too added the power
                    of his stentorian lungs to the clamor, as a young senator, splendidly dressed,
                    and of an aspect that could not fail to attract attention, entered the little
                    space, which had been kept open at the corner of the two streets, by the efforts
                    of an ædile and his beadles, who had just arrived on the ground. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He was not much, if at all, above the middle size, but admirably proportioned,
                    whether for feats of agility and strength, or for the lighter graces of society.
                    But it was his face more especially, and the magnificent expression of his
                    features, that first struck the beholder—the broad imaginative brow, the keen
                    large lustrous eye, pervading, clear, undazzled as the eagle's, the bold Roman
                    nose, the resolute curve of the clean-cut mouth, full of indomitable pride and
                    matchless energy—all these bespoke at once the versatile and various genius of
                    the great statesman, orator, and captain, who was to be thereafter. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> At this time, however, although he was advancing toward middle age, and had
                    already shaken off some of the trammels which luxurious vice and heedless
                    extravagance had cast around his young puissant intellect, he had achieved
                    nothing either of fame or power. He had, it is true, given signs of rare
                    intellect, but as yet they were signs only. Though his friends looked forward
                    confidently to the time, when they should see him the first citizen of the
                    republic; and it is more than possible, that in his own heart he contemplated
                    even now the attainment of a more glorious, if more perilous elevation. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The locks of this noble looking personage, though not arranged in that
                    effeminate fashion, which has been mentioned as characteristic of Cethegus and
                    some others, were closely curled about his brow—for he, as yet, exhibited no
                    tendency to that baldness, for which in after years he was remarkable—and
                    reeked with the choicest perfumes. He <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>wore the
                    crimson-bordered toga of his senatorial rank, but under it, as it waved loosely
                    to and fro, might be observed the gaudy hues of a violet colored banqueting
                    dress, sprinkled with flowers of gold, as if he had been disturbed from some
                    festive board by the summons to council. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> As he passed through the crowd, from which loud rose the shout, following him as
                    he moved along—"Hail, Caius Cæsar! long live the noble Cæsar!"—his slaves
                    scattered gold profusely among the multitude, who fought and scrambled for the
                    glittering coin, still keeping up their clamorous greeting; while the dispenser
                    of the wasteful largesse appearing to know every one, and to forget no face or
                    name, even of the humblest, had a familiar smile and a cheery word for each
                    citizen. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ha! Bassus, my old hero!" he exclaimed, "it is long since thou hast been to
                    visit me. That proves, I hope, that things go better now-a-days at home. But
                    come and see me, Bassus; I have something for thee to keep the cold from thy
                    hearth, this freezing weather." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And he paused not to receive an answer, but moved forward a step or two, till
                    his eye fell upon the swordsmith. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "What, Caius," he said, "sturdy Caius, absent from his forge so early—but I
                    forgot, I forgot! you are a politician, perhaps you can tell me why they have
                    roused me from the best cup of Massic I have tasted this ten years. What is the
                    coil, Caius Crispus?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Nay! I know not," replied the mechanic, "I was about to ask the same of you,
                    noble Cæsar!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I am the worst man living of whom to inquire," replied the patrician, with a
                    careless smile. "I cannot even guess, unless perchance"—but as he spoke, he
                    discovered, standing beside the smith, the man who had called himself Fulvius
                    Flaccus, and interrupting himself instantly, he fixed a long and piercing gaze
                    upon him, and then exclaimed "Ha! is it thou?" with an expression of
                    astonishment, not all unmixed with vexation. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The next moment he stepped close up to him, whispered a word into his ear, and
                    hurried with an altered air up the steep street which scaled the Palatine. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A minute or two afterward, Crispus turned to address this man, but he too was
                    gone. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In quick succession senator after senator now came up <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span>the gentle slope of the Sacred Way, until almost all the distinguished men in
                    Rome, whether for good or for evil, had undergone the scrutiny of the group
                    collected around Caius Crispus. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But it was not till among the last that Catiline strode by, gnawing his nether
                    lip uneasily, with his wild sunken eyes glaring suspiciously about him. He spoke
                    to no one, until he came opposite the smith, on whom he frowned darkly,
                    exclaiming, "What do you here? Go home, sirrah, go home!" and as Caius dropped
                    his bold eyes, crest-fallen and abashed, he added in a lower tone, so that, save
                    Bassus only, none of the crowd could hear him, "Wait for me at my house. Evil is
                    brewing!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Not a word more was spoken. Crispus and the old man soon extricated themselves
                    from the throng and went their way; and in a little time afterward the multitude
                    was dispersed, rather summarily, by a band of armed men under the Prætor
                    Pomptinus, who cleared with very little delicacy the confines of the Palatine,
                    whereon it was announced that the senate were now in secret session. </p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Among all those of Senatorial rank—and they were very many—who were
                    participants of the intended treason, one alone was absent from the assemblage
                    of the Order on that eventful night. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The keen unquiet eye of the arch-traitor missed Curius from his place, as it ran
                    over the known faces of the conspirators, on whom he reckoned for support. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Curius was absent. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Nor did his absence, although it might well be, although indeed it <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">was</span></span>, accidental, diminish anything of Catiline's anxiety.
                    For, though he fully believed him trusty and faithful to the end, though he felt
                    that the man was linked to him indissolubly by the consciousness of common
                    crimes, he knew him also to be no less vain than he was daring. And, while he
                    had no fear of intentional betrayal, he apprehended the possibility of
                    involuntary disclosures, that might be perilous, if not fatal, in the present
                    juncture. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It has been left on record of this Curius, by one who knew him well, and was
                    himself no mean judge of character, that he possessed not the faculty of
                    concealing any <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>thing he had heard, or even of
                    dissembling his own crimes; and Catiline was not one to overlook or mistake so
                    palpable a weakness. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But the truth was, that knowing his man thoroughly, he was aware that, with the
                    bane, he bore about with him, in some degree, its antidote. For so vast and
                    absurd were his vain boastings, and so needless his exaggerations of his own
                    recklessness, blood-thirstiness, and crime, that hitherto his vaporings had
                    excited rather ridicule than fear. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The time was however coming, when they were to awaken distrust, and lead to
                    disclosure. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was perfectly consistent with the audacity of Catiline—an audacity, which,
                    though natural, stood him well in stead, as a mask to cover deep designs—that
                    even now, when he felt himself to be more than suspected, instead of avoiding
                    notoriety, and shunning the companionship of his fellow traitors, he seemed to
                    covet observation, and to display himself in connection with his guilty
                    partners, more openly than heretofore. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But neither Lentulus, nor Vargunteius, nor the Syllæ, nor any other of the
                    plotters had seen Curius, or could inform him of his whereabout. And, ere they
                    separated for the night, amid the crash of the contending elements above, and
                    the roar of the turbulent populace below, doubt, and almost dismay, had sunk
                    into the hearts of several the most daring, so far as mere mortal perils were to
                    be encountered, but the most abject, when superstition was joined with conscious
                    guilt to appal and confound them. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Catiline left the others, and strode away homeward, more agitated and unquiet
                    than his face or words, or anything in his demeanor, except his irregular pace,
                    and fitful gestures indicated. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Dark curses quivered unspoken on his tongue—the pains of hell were in his heart
                    already. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Had he but known the whole, how would his fury have blazed out into instant
                    action. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> At the very moment when the Senate was so suddenly convoked on the Palatine, a
                    woman of rare loveliness waited alone, in a rich and voluptuous chamber of a
                    house not far removed from the scene of those grave deliberations. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The chamber, in which she reclined alone on a pile of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>soft cushions, might well have been the shrine of that bland queen of love
                    and pleasure, of whom its fair tenant was indeed an assiduous votaress. For
                    there was nothing, which could charm the senses, or lap the soul in luxurious
                    and effeminate ease, that was not there displayed. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The walls glowed with the choicest specimens of the Italian pencil, and the soft
                    tones and harmonious colouring were well adapted to the subjects, which were the
                    same in all—voluptuous and sensual love. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Here Venus rose from the crisp-smiling waves, in a rich atmosphere of light and
                    beauty—there Leda toyed with the wreathed neck and ruffled plumage of the
                    enamoured swan—in this compartment, Danaë lay warm and languid, impotent to
                    resist the blended power of the God's passion and his gold—in that, Ariadne
                    clung delighted to the bosom of the rosy wine-God. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The very atmosphere of the apartment was redolent of the richest perfumes, which
                    streamed from four censers of chased gold placed on a tall candelabra of wrought
                    bronze in the corners of the room. A bowl of stained glass on the table was
                    filled with musk roses, the latest of the year; and several hyacinths in full
                    bloom added their almost overpowering scent to the aromatic odours of the
                    burning incense. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Armed chairs, with downy pillows, covered with choice embroidered cloths of
                    Calabria, soft ottomans and easy couches, tables loaded with implements of
                    female luxury, musical instruments, drawings, and splendidly illuminated rolls
                    of the amatory bards and poetesses of the Egean islands, completed the picture
                    of the boudoir of the Roman beauty. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And on a couch piled with the Tyrian cushions, which yielded to the soft impress
                    of her lovely form, well worthy of the splendid luxury with which she was
                    surrounded, lay the unrivalled Fulvia, awaiting her expected lover. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> If she was lovely in her rich attire, as she appeared at the board of Catiline,
                    with jewels in her bosom, and her bright ringlets of luxuriant gold braided in
                    fair array, far lovelier was she now, as she lay there reclined, with those
                    bright ringlets all dishevelled, and falling in a flood of wavy silken masses,
                    over her snowy shoulders, and palpitating bosom; with all the undulating
                    outlines of her su<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>perb form, unadorned, and but
                    scantily concealed by a loose robe of snow-white linen. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Her face was slightly flushed with a soft carnation tinge, her blue eyes gleamed
                    with unusual brightness. And by the fluttering of her bosom, and the nervous
                    quivering of her slender fingers, as they leaned on a tripod of Parian marble
                    which stood beside the couch, it was evident that she was labouring under some
                    violent excitement. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "He comes not," she said. "And it is waxing late. He has again failed me! and if
                    he have—ruin—ruin!—Debts pressing me in every quarter, and no hope but from
                    him. Alfenus the usurer will lend no more—my farms all mortgaged to the utmost,
                    a hundred thousand sesterces of interest, due these last Calends, and unpaid as
                    yet. What can I do?—what hope for? In him there is no help—none! Nay! It is
                    vain to think of it; for he is amorous as ever, and, could he raise the money,
                    would lavish millions on me for one kiss. No! <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">he</span></span> is
                    bankrupt too; and all his promises are but wild empty boastings. What, then, is
                    left to me?" she cried aloud, in the intensity of her perturbation. "Most
                    miserable me! My creditors will seize on all—all—all! and poverty—hard,
                    chilling, bitter poverty, is staring in my face even now. Ye Gods! ye Gods! And
                    I can not—can not live poor. No more rich dainties, and rare wines! no downy
                    couches and soft perfumes! No music to induce voluptuous slumbers! no
                    fairy-fingered slaves to fan the languid brow into luxurious coolness! No
                    revelry, no mirth, no pleasure! Pleasure that is so sweet, so enthralling!
                    Pleasure for which I have lived only, without which I must die! <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Die</span></span>! By the great Gods! I <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></span>
                    die! What avails life, when all its joys are gone? Or what is death, but one
                    momentary pang, and then—quiet? Yes! I will die. And the world shall learn that
                    the soft Epicurean can vie with the cold Stoic in carelessness of living, and
                    contempt of death—that the warm votaress of Aphrodite can spend her glowing
                    life-blood as prodigally as the stern follower of Virtue! Lucretia died, and was
                    counted great and noble, because she cared not to survive her honour! Fulvia
                    will perish, wiser, as soon as she shall have outlived her capacity for
                    pleasure!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> She spoke enthusiastically, her bright eyes flashing a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>strange fire, and her white bosom panting with the strong and passionate
                    excitement; but in a moment her mood was changed. A smile, as if at her own
                    vehemence, curled her lip; her glance lost its quick, sharp wildness. She
                    clapped her hands together, and called aloud, </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Ho! Ægle! Ægle!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And at the call a beautiful Greek girl entered the chamber, voluptuous as her
                    mistress in carriage and demeanor, and all too slightly robed for modesty, in
                    garments that displayed far more than they concealed of her rare symmetry. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Bring wine, my girl," cried Fulvia; "the richest Massic; and, hark thee, fetch
                    thy lyre. My soul is dark to-night, and craves a joyous note to kindle it to
                    life and rapture." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The girl bowed and retired; but in a minute or two returned, accompanied by a
                    dark-eyed Ionian, bearing a Tuscan flask of the choice wine, and a goblet of
                    crystal, embossed with emeralds and sapphires, imbedded, by a process known to
                    the ancients but now lost, in the transparent glass. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A lyre of tortoiseshell was in the hands of Ægle, and a golden plectrum with
                    which to strike its chords; she had cast loose her abundant tresses of dark
                    hair, and decked her brows with a coronal of myrtle mixed with roses, and as she
                    came bounding with sinuous and graceful gestures through the door, waving her
                    white arms with the dazzling instruments aloft, she might have represented well
                    a young priestess of the Cyprian queen, or the light Muse of amorous song. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The other girl filled out a goblet of the amber-coloured wine, the fragrance of
                    which overpowered, for a moment, as it mantled on the goblet's brim, the
                    aromatic perfumes which loaded the atmosphere of the apartment. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And Fulvia raised it to her lips, and sipped it slowly, and delightedly,
                    suffering it to glide drop by drop between her rosy lips, to linger on her
                    pleased palate, luxuriating in its soft richness, and dwelling long and
                    rapturously on its flavour. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> After a little while, the goblet was exhausted, a warmer hue came into her
                    velvet cheeks, a brighter spark danced in her azure eyes, and as she motioned
                    the Ionian slave-<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>girl to replenish the cup and place
                    it on the tripod at her elbow, she murmured in a low languid tone, </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Sing to me, now—sing to me, Ægle." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And in obedience to her word the lovely girl bent her fair form over the lute,
                    and, after a wild prelude full of strange thrilling melodies, poured out a voice
                    as liquid and as clear, aye! and as soft, withal, as the nightingale's, in a
                    soft Sapphic love-strain full of the glorious poetry of her own lovely language. </p>

                    aside, and with a noiseless step Curius entered the apartment, unseen by the
                    fair vocalist, whose back was turned to him, and made a sign to Fulvia that she
                    should not appear to notice his arrival. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The haggard and uneasy aspect, which was peculiar to this man—the care-worn
                    expression, half-anxious and half-jaded, which has been previously described,
                    was less conspicuous on this occasion than ever it had been before, since the
                    light lady loved him. There was a feverish flush on his face, a joyous gleam in
                    his dark eye, and a self-satisfied smile lighting up all his features, which led
                    her to believe at first that he had been drinking deeply; and secondly, that by
                    some means or other he had succeeded in collecting the vast sum she had required
                    of him, as the unworthy price of future favours. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In a minute or two, the voluptuous strain ended; and, ere she knew that any
                    stranger listened to her amatory warblings, the arm of Curius was wound about
                    her slender waist, and his half-laughing voice was ringing in her ear, </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Well sung, my lovely Greek, and daintily advised!—By my faith! sweet one, I
                    will take thee at thy word!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No! no!" cried the girl, extricating herself from his arms, by an elastic
                    spring, before his lips could touch her cheek. "No! no! you shall not kiss me.
                    Kiss Fulvia, she is handsomer than I am, and loves you too. Come, Myrrha, let us
                    leave them." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And, with an arch smile and coquettish toss of her pretty head, she darted
                    through the door, and was followed instantly by the other slave-girl, well
                    trained to divine the wishes of her mistress. </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

                    nearer to his mistress; "you are more beautiful to-night than <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ever</span></span>." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Flatterer!" murmured the lady, suffering him to enfold her in his arms, and
                    taste her lips for a moment. But the next minute she withdrew herself from his
                    embrace, and said, half-smiling, half-abashed, "But flattery will not pay my
                    debts. Have you brought me the moneys for Alfenus, my sweet Curius? the hundred
                    thousand sesterces, you promised me?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Perish the dross!" cried Curius, fiercely. "Out on it! when I come to you,
                    burning with love and passion, you cast cold water on the flames, by your
                    incessant cry for gold. By all the Gods! I do believe, that you love me only for
                    that you can wring from my purse." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "If it be so," replied the lady, scornfully, "I surely do not love you much;
                    seeing it is three months, since you have brought me so much as a ring, or a
                    jewel for a keepsake! But you should rather speak the truth out plainly,
                    Curius," she continued, in an altered tone, "and confess honestly that you care
                    for me no longer. If you loved me as once you did, you would not leave me to be
                    goaded by these harpies. Know you not—why do I ask? you <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">do</span></span> know that my house, my slaves, nay! that my very jewels and my
                    garments, are mine but upon sufferance. It wants but a few days of the calends
                    of November, and if they find the interest unpaid, I shall be cast forth,
                    shamed, and helpless, into the streets of Rome!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Be it so!" answered Curius, with an expression which she could not comprehend.
                    "Be it so! Fulvia; and if it be, you shall have any house in Rome you will, for
                    your abode. What say you to Cicero's, in the Carinæ? or the grand portico of
                    Quintus Catulus, rich with the Cimbric spoils? or, better yet, that of Crassus,
                    with its Hymettian columns, on the Palatine? Aye! aye! the speech of Marcus
                    Brutus was prophetic; who termed it, the other day, the house of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Venus</span></span> on the Palatine! And you, my love, shall be the
                    goddess of that shrine! It shall be yours <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">to-morrow</span></span>, if
                    you will—so you will drive away the clouds from that sweet brow, and let those
                    eyes beam forth—by all the Gods!"—he interrupted himself—"I <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></span> kiss thee!" </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "By all the Gods! thou shalt not—now, nor for evermore!" she replied, in her
                    turn growing very angry.—"Thou foolish and mendacious boaster! what? dost thou
                    deem me mad or senseless, to assail me with such drivelling folly? Begone, fool!
                    or I will call my slaves—I <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">have</span></span> slaves yet, and, if it
                    be the last deed of service they do for me, they shall spurn thee, like a dog,
                    from my doors.—Art thou insane, or only drunken, Curius?" she added, breaking
                    off from her impetuous railing, into a cool sarcastic tone, that stung him to
                    the quick. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "You shall see whether of the two, Harlot!" he replied furiously, thrusting his
                    hand into the bosom of his tunic, as if to seek a weapon. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Harlot!" she exclaimed, springing to her feet, the hot blood rushing to her
                    brow in torrents—"dare you say this to me?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Dare! do you call this daring?" answered the savage. "This? what would you call
                    it, then, to devastate the streets of Rome with flame and falchion—to hurl the
                    fabric of the state headlong down from the blazing Capitol—to riot in the gore
                    of senators, patricians, consulars!—What, to aspire to be the lords and
                    emperors of the universe?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "What mean you?" she exclaimed, moved greatly by his vehemence, and beginning to
                    suspect that this was something more than his mere ordinary boasting and
                    exaggeration. "What can you mean? oh! tell me; if you do love me, as you once
                    did, tell me, Curius!" and with rare artifice she altered her whole manner in an
                    instant, all the expression of eye, lip, tone and accent, from the excess of
                    scorn and hatred, to blandishment and fawning softness. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No!" he replied sullenly. "I will not tell you—no! You doubt me, distrust me,
                    scorn me—no! I will tell you nothing! I will have all I wish or ask for, on my
                    own terms—you shall grant all, or die!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And he unsheathed his dagger, as he spoke, and grasping her wrist violently with
                    his left hand, offered the weapon at her throat with his right—"You shall grant
                    all, or die!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Never!"—she answered—"never!" looking him steadily yet softly in the face,
                    with her beautiful blue eyes. "To fear I will never yield, whatever I may do, to
                    love or passion. Strike, if you will—strike a weak woman, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> so prove your daring—it will be easier, if not so noble, as
                    slaying senators and consuls!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Perdition!" cried the fierce conspirator, "I <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></span> kill
                    her!" And with the word he raised his arm, as if to strike; and, for a moment,
                    the guilty and abandoned sensualist believed that her hour was come. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Yet she shrunk not, nor quailed before his angry eye, nor uttered any cry or
                    supplication. She would have died that moment, as carelessly as she had lived.
                    She would have died, acting out her character to the last sand of life, with the
                    smile on her lip, and the soft languor in her melting eye, in all things an
                    Epicurean. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But the fierce mood of Curius changed. Irresolute, and impotent of evil, in a
                    scarce less degree than he was sanguinary, rash, unprincipled, and fearless, it
                    is not one of the least strange events, connected with a conspiracy the whole of
                    which is strange, and much almost inexplicable, that a man so wise, so
                    sagacious, so deep-sighted, as the arch traitor, should have placed confidence
                    in one so fickle and infirm of purpose. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> His knitted brow relaxed, the hardness of his eye relented, he cast the dagger
                    from him. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The next moment, suffering the scarf to fall from her white and dazzling
                    shoulders, the beautiful but bad enchantress flung herself upon his bosom, in
                    the abandonment of her dishevelled beauty, winding her snowy arms about his
                    neck, smothering his voice with kisses. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A moment more, and she was seated on his knee, with his left arm about her
                    waist, drinking with eager and attentive ears, that suffered not a single detail
                    to escape them, the fullest revelation of that atrocious plot, the days, the
                    very hours of action, the numbers, names, and rank of the conspirators! </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A woman's infamy rewarded the base villain's double treason! A woman's infamy
                    saved Rome! </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Two hours later, the crash and roar of the hurricane and earthquake cut short
                    their guilty pleasures. Curius rushed into the streets headlong, almost deeming
                    that the insurrection might have exploded prematurely, and found it—more than
                    half frustrated. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Fulvia, while yet the thunder rolled, and the blue lightning flashed above her
                    head, and the earth reeled beneath <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>her footsteps,
                    went forth, strong in the resolution of that Roman patriotism, which, nursed by
                    the institutions of the age, and the pride of the haughty heart, stood with her,
                    as it did with so many others, in lieu of any other principle, of any other
                    virtue. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Closely veiled, unattended even by a single slave, that delicate luxurious
                    sinner braved the wild fury of the elements; braved the tumultuous frenzy, and
                    more tumultuous terror, of the disorganised and angry populace; braved the dark
                    superstition, which crept upon her as she marked the awful portents of that
                    night, and half persuaded her to the belief that there were Powers on high, who
                    heeded the ways, punished the crimes of mortals. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And that strange sense grew on her more and more, though she resisted it,
                    incredulous, when after a little while she sat side by side with the wise and
                    virtuous Consul, and marked the calmness, almost divine, of his thoughtful
                    benignant features, as he heard the full details of the awful crisis, heretofore
                    but suspected, in which he stood, as if upon the verge of a scarce slumbering
                    volcano. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> What passed between that frail woman, and the wise orator, none ever fully knew.
                    But they parted—on his side with words of encouragement and kindness—on her's
                    with a sense of veneration approaching almost to religious awe. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And the next day, the usurer Alfenus received in full the debt, both principal
                    and interest, which he had long despaired of touching. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But when the Great Man stood alone in his silent study, that strange and
                    unexpected interview concluded, he turned his eyes upward, not looking, even
                    once, toward the sublime bust of Jupiter which stood before him, serene in more
                    than mortal grandeur; extended both his arms, and prayed in solemn accents— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "All thanks to thee, Omnipotent, Ubiquitous, Eternal, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">One</span></span>!
                    whom we, vain fools of fancy, adore in many forms, and under many names; invest
                    with the low attributes of our own earthy nature; enshrine in mortal shapes, and
                    human habitations! But thou, who wert, before the round world was, or the blue
                    heaven o'erhung it; who wilt be, when those shall be no longer,—thou pardonest
                    our madness, guidest our blindness, guardest our weakness. Thou, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> by the basest and most loathed instruments, dost
                    work out thy great ends. All thanks, then, be to thee, by whatsoever name thou
                    wouldest be addressed; to thee, whose dwelling is illimitable space, whose
                    essence is in every thing that we behold, that moves, that is—to thee whom I
                    hail, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>! For thou hast given it to me to save my country.
                    And whether I die now, by this assassin's knife, or live a little longer to
                    behold the safety I establish, I have lived long enough, and am content to
                    die!—Whether this death be, as philosophers have told us, a dreamless,
                    senseless, and interminable trance; or, as I sometimes dream, a brief and
                    passing slumber, from which we shall awaken into a purer, brighter, happier
                    being—I have lived long enough! and when thou callest me, will answer to thy
                    summons, glad and grateful! For Rome, at least, survives me, and shall perchance
                    survive, 'till time itself is ended, the Queen of Universal Empire!" </p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The morning of the eighteenth of October, the day so eagerly looked forward to
                    by the conspirators, and so much dreaded by the good citizens of the republic,
                    had arrived. And now was seen, as it will oftentimes happen, that when great
                    events, however carefully concealed, are on the point of coming to light, a sort
                    of vague rumour, or indefinite anticipation, is found running through the whole
                    mass of society—a rumour, traceable to no one source, possessing no authority,
                    and deserving no credibility from its origin, or even its distinctness; yet in
                    the main true and correct—an anticipation of I know not what terrible, unusual,
                    and exaggerated issue, yet, after all, not very different from what is really
                    about to happen. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Thus it was at this period; and—though it is quite certain, that on the
                    preceding evening, at the convocation of the senate, no person except Cicero and
                    Paullus, unconnected with the conspiracy, knew anything at all of the intended
                    massacre and conflagration; though no one of the plotters had yet broken faith
                    with his fellows; and though none of the leaders dared avow their schemes
                    openly, even to the discontented populace, with whom they felt no sympathy, and
                    from whom they expected no cor<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>dial or general
                    cooperation—it is equally certain that for many days, and even months past,
                    there had been a feverish and excited state of the public mind; an agitation and
                    restlessness of the operative classes; an indistinct and vague alarm of the
                    noble and wealthy orders; which had increased gradually until it was now at its
                    height. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Among all these parties, this restlessness had taken the shape of anticipation,
                    either dreadful or desirable, of some great change, of some strange
                    novelty—though no one, either of the wishers or fearers, could explain what it
                    was he wished or feared—to be developed at the consular comitia. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And amid this confusion, most congenial to his bold and scornful spirit,
                    Catiline stalked, like the arch magician, to and fro, amid the wild and
                    fantastic shapes of terror which he has himself evoked, marking the hopes of
                    this one, as indications of an unknown, yet sure friend; and revelling in the
                    terrors of that, as certain evidences of an enemy too weak and powerless to be
                    formidable to his projects. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It is true, that a year before, previous to Cicero's elevation to the chief
                    magistracy, and previous to the murder of Piso by his own adherents on his way
                    to Spain, the designs of Catiline had been suspected dangerous; and, as such,
                    had contributed to the election of his rival; his own faction succeeding only in
                    carrying in Antonius, the second and least dreaded of their candidates. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Him Cicero, by rare management and much self-sacrifice, had contrived to bring
                    over to the cause of the commonwealth; although he had so far kept his faith
                    with Catiline, as to disclose none, if indeed he knew any of his infamous
                    designs. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In consequence of this defeat, and this subsequent secession of one on whom they
                    had, perhaps, prematurely reckoned, the conspirators, all but their indomitable
                    and unwearied leader, had been for some time paralyzed. And this fact, joined to
                    the extreme caution of their latter proceedings, had tended to throw a shade of
                    doubt over the previous accusation, and to create a sense of carelessness and
                    almost of disbelief in the minds of the majority, as to the real existence of
                    any schemes at all against the commonwealth. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Under all these circumstances, it cannot be doubted, for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a moment, that had Catiline and his friends entertained any real
                    desire of ameliorating the condition of the masses, of extending the privileges,
                    or improving the condition, of the discontented and suffering plebeians, they
                    could have overturned the ancient fabric of Rome's world-conquering oligarchy. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But the truth is, they dreamed of nothing less, than of meddling at all with the
                    condition of the people; on whom they looked merely as tools and instruments for
                    the present, and sources of plunder and profit in the future. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> They could not trust the plebeians, because they knew that the plebeians, in
                    their turn, could not trust them. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The dreadful struggles of Marius, Cinna, and Sylla, had convinced those of all
                    classes, who possessed any stake in the well being of the country; any estate or
                    property, however humble, down even to the tools of daily labour, and the
                    occupation of permanent stalls for daily traffic, that it was neither change,
                    nor revolution, nor even larger liberty—much less proscription, civil strife,
                    and fire-raising—but rest, but tranquillity, but peace, that they required. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was not to the people, therefore, properly so called, but to the dissolute
                    and ruined outcasts of the aristocracy, and to the lowest rabble, the homeless,
                    idle, vicious, drunken <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">poor</span></span>, who having nothing to love,
                    have necessarily all to gain, by havoc and rapine, that the conspirators looked
                    for support. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The first class of these was won, bound by oaths, only less binding than their
                    necessities and desperation, sure guaranties for their good faith. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The second—Catiline well knew that—needed no winning. The first clang of arms
                    in the streets, the first blaze of incendiary flames, no fear but they would
                    rise to rob, to ravish, and slay—ensuring that grand anarchy which he proposed
                    to substitute for the existing state of things, and on which he hoped to build
                    up his own tyrannous and blood-cemented empire. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> So stood affairs on the evening of the seventeenth; and, although at times a
                    suspicion—not a fear, for of that he was incapable—flitted across the mind of
                    the traitor, that things were not going on as he could wish them; that the
                    alienation of Paullus Arvina, and the absence of his injured daughter, must
                    probably work together to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>discomfiture of the
                    conspiracy; still, as hour after hour passed away, and no discovery was made, he
                    revelled in his anticipated triumph. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Of the interview between Paullus and Lucia, he was as yet unaware; and, with
                    that singular inconsistency which is to be found in almost every mind, although
                    he disbelieved, as a principle, in the existence of honor at all, he yet never
                    doubted that young Arvina would hold himself bound strictly by the pledge of
                    secrecy which he had reiterated, after the frustration of the murderous attempt
                    against his life, in the cave of Egeria. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Nor did he err in his premises; for had not Arvina been convinced that new and
                    more perilous schemes were on the point of being executed against himself, he
                    would have remained silent as to the names of the traitors; however he might
                    have deemed it his duty to reveal the meditated treason. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> With his plans therefore all matured, his chief subordinates drilled thoroughly
                    to the performance of their parts, his minions armed and ready, he doubted not
                    in the least, as he gazed on the setting sun, that the next rising of the great
                    luminary would look down on the conflagration of the suburbs, on the slaughter
                    of his enemies, and the triumphant elevation of himself to the supreme command
                    of the vast empire, for which he played so foully. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The morning came, the long desired sun arose, and all his plots were
                    countermined, all his hopes of immediate action paralyzed, if not utterly
                    destroyed. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Senate, assembled on the previous evening at a moment's notice, had been
                    taken by surprise so completely by the strange revelations made to them by their
                    Consul, that not one of the advocates or friends of Catiline arose to say one
                    syllable in his defence; and he himself, quick-witted, ready, daring as he was,
                    and fearing neither man nor God, was for once thunderstricken and astonished. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The address of the Consul was short, practical, and to the point; and the danger
                    he foretold to the order was so terrible, while the inconvenience of deferring
                    the elections was so small, and its occurrence so frequent—a sudden tempest,
                    the striking of the standard on the Janiculum, the interruption of a tribune, or
                    the slightest infor<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>mality in the augural rites
                    sufficing to interrupt them—that little objection was made in any quarter, to
                    the motion of Cicero, that the comitia should be delayed, until the matter could
                    be thoroughly investigated. For he professed only as yet to possess a clue,
                    which he promised hereafter to unravel to the end. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Catiline had, however, so far recovered from his consternation, that he had
                    risen to address the house, when the first words he uttered were drowned by a
                    strange and unearthly sound, like the rumbling of ten thousand chariots over a
                    stony way, beginning, as it seemed, underneath their feet, and rising gradually
                    until it died away over head in the murky air. Before there was time for any
                    comment on this extraordinary sound, a tremulous motion crept through the marble
                    pavements, increasing every moment, until the doors flew violently open, and the
                    vast columns and thick walls of the stately temple reeled visibly in the dread
                    earthquake. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Nor was this all, for as the portals opened, in the black skies, right opposite
                    the entrance, there stood, glaring with red and lurid light, a bearded star or
                    comet; which, to the terror-stricken eyes of the Fathers, seemed a portentous
                    sword, brandished above the city. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The groans and shrieks of the multitude, rushed in with an appalling sound to
                    increase their superstitious awe; and to complete the whole, a pale and ghastly
                    messenger was ushered into the house, announcing that a bright lambent flame was
                    sitting on the lance-heads of the Prætor's guard, which had been summoned to
                    protect the Senate in its deliberations. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A fell sneer curled the lip of Catiline. He was not even superstitious.
                    Self-vanity and confidence in his own powers, and long impunity in crime, had
                    hardened him, had maddened him, almost to Atheism. Yet he dared not attack the
                    sacred prejudices of the men, whom, but for that occurrence, he had yet hoped to
                    win to their own undoing. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But, as he saw their blanched visages, and heard their mutterings of terror, he
                    saw likewise that an impression was made on their minds, which no words of his
                    could for the present counteract. And, with a sneering smile at fears which he
                    knew not, and a smothered curse at <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a name="Pg214" id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the accident, as
                    he termed it, which had foiled him, he sat down silent. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "The Gods have spoken!" exclaimed Cicero, flinging his arms abroad majestically.
                    "The guilty are struck dumb! The Gods have spoken aloud their sympathy for
                    Rome's peril; and will ye, ye its chosen sons, whose all of happiness and life
                    lie in its sanctity and safety, will ye, I say, love your own country, your own
                    mother, less than the Gods love her?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The moment was decisive, the appeal irresistible. By acclamation the vote was
                    carried; no need to debate or to divide the House—'that the elections be
                    deferred until the eleventh day before the Calends, and that the Senate meet
                    again to-morrow, shortly after sunrise, to deliberate what shall be done to
                    protect the Republic?' </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Morning came, dark indeed, and lurid, and more like the close, than the opening
                    of day. Morning came, but it brought no change with it; for not a head in Rome
                    had lain that night upon a pillow, save those of the unburied dead, or the
                    bedridden. Young men and aged, sick and sound, masters and slaves, had wooed no
                    sleep during the hours of darkness, so terribly, so constantly was it
                    illuminated by the broad flashes of blue lightning, and the strange meteors,
                    which rushed almost incessantly athwart the sky. The winds too had been all
                    unchained in their fury, and went howling like tormented spirits, over the
                    terrified and trembling city. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was said too, that the shades of the dead had arisen, and were seen mingling
                    in the streets with the living, scarcely more livid than the half-dead
                    spectators of portents so ominous. No rumour so absurd or fanatical, but it
                    found on that night, implicit credence. Some shouted in the streets and open
                    places, that the patricians and the knights were arming their adherents for a
                    promiscuous massacre of the people. Some, that the gladiators had broken loose,
                    and slain thousands of citizens already! Some, that there was a Gallic tumult,
                    and that the enemy would be at the gates in the morning! Some that the Gods had
                    judged Rome to destruction! </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And so they raved, and roared, and sometimes fought; and would have rioted
                    tremendously; for many of the commoner conspirators were abroad, ready to take
                        advan<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tage of any casual incident to breed an
                    affray; but that a strong force of civil magistrates patrolled the streets with
                    armed attendants; and that, during the night several cohorts were brought in,
                    from the armies of Quintus Marcius Rex, and Quintus Metellus Creticus, with all
                    their armor and war weapons, in heavy marching order; and occupied the Capitol,
                    the Palatine, and the Janiculum, and all the other prominent and commanding
                    points of the city, with an array that set opposition at defiance. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> So great, however, were the apprehensions of many of the nobles, that Rome was
                    on the eve of a servile insurrection, that many of them armed their freedmen,
                    and imprisoned all their slaves; while others, the more generous and milder, who
                    thought they could rely on the attachment of their people, weaponed their slaves
                    themselves, and fortified their isolated dwellings against the anticipated
                    onslaught. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Thus passed that terrible and tempestuous night; the roar of the elements,
                    unchained as they were, and at their work of havoc, not sufficing to drown the
                    dissonant and angry cries of men, the clash of weapons, and the shrill clamor of
                    women; which made Rome more resemble the Pandemonium than the metropolis of the
                    world's most civilized and mightiest nation. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But now morning had come at length; and gradually, as the storm ceased, and the
                    heavens resumed their natural appearance, the terrors and the fury of the
                    multitude subsided; and, partly satisfied by the constant and well-timed
                    proclamations of the magistrates, partly convinced that for the moment there was
                    no hope of successful outrage, and yet more wearied out with their own turbulent
                    vehemence, whether of fear or anger, the crowd began to retire to their houses,
                    and the streets were left empty and silent. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> As the day dawned, there was no banner hoisted on the Janiculum, although its
                    turrets might be seen bristling with the short massive javelins of the legions,
                    and gleaming with the tawny light that flashed from their brazen casques and
                    corslets. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> There was no augural tent pitched on the hills without the city walls, wherefrom
                    to take the auspices. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And above all, there were no loud and stirring calls of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the brazen trumpets of the centuries, to summon forth the civic
                    army of the Roman people to the Campus, there to elect their rulers for the
                    ensuing year. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was apparent therefore to all men, that the elections would not be held that
                    day, though none knew clearly wherefore they had been deferred. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> While the whole city was loud with turbulent confusion—for, as morning broke,
                    and it was known that the comitia were postponed, the agitation of terror
                    succeeded to that of insubordination—Hortensia and her daughter sat together,
                    pale, anxious, and heartsick, yet firm and free from all unworthy evidences of
                    dismay. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> During the past night, which had been to both a sleepless one, they had sate
                    listening, lone and weak women, to the roar of tumultuous streets, and expecting
                    at every moment they knew not what of violence and outrage. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Paullus Arvina had come in once to reassure them: and informed them that the
                    vigilance of the Consul had been crowned with success, and that the danger of a
                    conflict in the streets was subsiding every moment. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Still, the care which he bestowed on examining the fastenings of the doors, and
                    such windows as looked into the streets, the earnestness with which he
                    inculcated watchful heed to the armed slaves of the household, and the positive
                    manner in which he insisted on leaving Thrasea and a dozen of his own trustiest
                    men to assist Hortensia's people, did more to obliterate the hopes his own words
                    would otherwise have excited, than the words themselves to excite them. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Nor was it, indeed, to be wondered that Hortensia should be liable, above other
                    women, not to base terror,—for of that from her high character she was
                    incapable—but to a settled apprehension and distrust of the Roman Populace. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was now four-and-twenty years since the city had been disturbed by plebeian
                    violence or aristocratic vengeance. Twenty-four years ago, the avenging sword of
                    Sylla had purged the state of its bloodthirsty demagogues, and their brute
                    followers; twenty-four years ago his powerful hand had reestablished Rome's
                    ancient constitution, full of checks and balances, which secured equal rights to
                    every Roman citizen; which secured all equality, in short <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to all men, save that which no human laws can give, equality of
                    social rank, and equality of wealth. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The years, however, which had gone before that restoration, the dreadful
                    massacres and yet more dreadful proscriptions of Cinna and Marius, had left
                    indelible and sanguinary traces on the ancestral tree of many a noble house; and
                    on none deeper than on that of Hortensia's family. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Her brother, Caius Julius, an orator second to none in those days, had been
                    murdered by the followers of Marius, almost before his sister's eyes, with
                    circumstances of appalling cruelty. Her house had been forced open by the
                    infuriate rabble, her husband hewn down with unnumbered wounds, on his own
                    hearth-stone, and her first born child tossed upon the revolutionary pike heads. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Her husband indeed recovered, almost miraculously, from his wounds, and lived to
                    see retribution fall upon the guilty partizans of Marius; but he was never well
                    again, and after languishing for years, died at last of the wounds he received
                    on that bloody day. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Good cause, then, had Hortensia to tremble at the tender mercies of the people. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Nor, though they struck the minds of these high-born ladies with less perplexity
                    and awe than the vulgar souls without, were the portents and horrors of the
                    heaven, without due effect. No mind in those days, however clear and
                    enlightened, but held some lingering belief that such things were ominous of
                    coming wrath, and sent by the Gods to inform their faithful worshippers. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was moreover fresh in her memory, how two years before, during the consulship
                    of Cotta and Torquatus, in a like terrible night-storm, the fire from heaven had
                    stricken down the highest turrets of the capitol, melted the brazen tables of
                    the law, and scathed the gilded effigy of Romulus and Remus, sucking their
                    shaggy foster-mother, which stood on the Capitoline. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The augurs in those days, collected from Etruria and all parts of Italy, after
                    long consultation, had proclaimed that unless the Gods should be appeased duly,
                    the end of Rome and her empire was at hand. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And now—what though for ten whole days consecutive the sacred games went on;
                    what though nothing had been omitted whereby to avert the immortal
                        indignation<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>—did not this heaven-born tempest
                    prove that the wrath was not soothed, that the decree yet stood firm? </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In such deep thoughts, and in the strong excitement of such expectation,
                    Hortensia and her daughter had passed that awful night; not without high
                    instructions from the elder lady, grave and yet stirring narratives of the great
                    men of old—how they strove fiercely, energetically, while strife could avail
                    anything; and how, when the last hope was over, they folded their hands in stern
                    and awful resignation, and met their fate unblenching, and with but one
                    care—that the decorum of their deaths should not prove unworthy the dignity of
                    their past lives. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Not without generous and noble resolutions on the part of both, that they too
                    would not be found wanting. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But there was nothing humble, nothing soft, in their stern and proud submission
                    to the inevitable necessity. Nothing of love toward the hand which dealt the
                    blow—nothing of confidence in supernal justice, much less in supernal mercy!
                    Nothing of that sweet hope, that undying trust, that consciousness of
                    self-unworthiness, that full conviction of a glorious future, which renders so
                    beautiful and happy the submission of a dying Christian. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> No! there were none of these things; for to the wisest and best of the ancients,
                    the foreshadowings of the soul's immortality were dim, faint, and uncertain. The
                    legends of their mythology held up such pictures of the sensuality and vice of
                    those whom they called Gods, that it was utterly impossible for any sound
                    understanding to accept them. And deep thinkers were consequently driven into
                    pure Deism, coupled too often with the Epicurean creed, that the Great Spirit
                    was too grand and too sublime to trouble himself with the brief doings of
                    mortality. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The whole scope of the Roman's hope and ambition, then, was limited to this
                    world; or, if there was a longing for anything beyond the term of mortality, it
                    was for a name, a memory, an immortality of good report. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And pride, which the christian, better instructed, knows to be the germ and root
                    of all sin, was to the Roman, the sole spring of honourable action, the sole
                    source of virtue. </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Now, with the morning, quiet was restored both to the angry skies, and to the
                    restless city. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Worn out with anxiety, and watching, sleep fell upon the eyes of Julia, as she
                    sat half recumbent in a large softly-cushioned chair of Etruscan bronze. Her
                    fair head fell back on the crimson pillow, with all its wealth of auburn
                    ringlets flowing dishevelled; and that soft still shadow, which is yet, in its
                    beautiful serenity, half terrible, so nearly is it allied to the shadow of that
                    sleep from which there comes no waking, fell over her pale features. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The mother gazed on her for a moment, with more gentleness in her eye, and a
                    milder smile on her face, than her indomitable pride often permitted her to
                    manifest. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "She sleeps"—she said, looking at her wistfully—"she sleeps! Aye! the young
                    sleep easily, even in their affliction. They sleep, and forget their sorrows,
                    and awaken, either to fresh woes, as soon to be obliterated, or to vain joys,
                    yet briefer, and more fleeting. Thoughtlessness to the young—anguish to the
                    old—such is mortality! And what beyond?—aye, what?—what that we should so
                    toil, so suffer, to be virtuous? Is it a dream, all a dream—this futurity? I
                    fear so"—and, with the words, she lapsed into a fit of solemn meditation, and
                    stood for many minutes <span class="tei tei-corr">silent</span>, and absorbed. Then a
                    keen light came into her dark eyes, a flash of animation coloured her pale
                    cheeks, she stretched her arms aloft, and in a clear sonorous voice—"No! no!"
                    she said, "Honour—honour—immortal honour; thou, at least, art no dream—thou
                    art worth dying, suffering, aye! worth <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">living</span></span> to obtain!
                    For what is life but the deeper sorrow, to the more virtuous and the nobler?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A few minutes longer she stood gazing on her daughter's beautiful face, until
                    the sound of voices louder than usual, and a slight bustle, in the peristyle,
                    attracted her attention. Then, after throwing a pallium, or shawl, of richly
                    embroidered woollen stuff over the fair form of the sleeper, she opened the door
                    leading to the garden colonnade, and left the room silently. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Scarcely had Hortensia disappeared, before the opposite door, by which the
                    saloon communicated with the atrium, was opened, and a slave entered, bearing a
                    small folded note, secured by a waxen seal, on a silver plate. </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He approached Julia's chair, apparently in some hesitation, as if he felt that
                    it was his duty, and was yet half afraid to awaken her. At length, however, he
                    made up his mind, and addressed a word or two to her, which were sufficiently
                    distinct to arouse her—for she started up and gazed wildly about her—but left
                    no clear impression of their meaning on her mind. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> This, however, the man did not appear to notice; at all events, he did not wait
                    to observe the effect of his communication, but quitted the room hastily, and in
                    considerable trepidation, leaving the note on the table. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Julia was sleeping very heavily, at the moment when she was so startled from her
                    slumber; and, as is not unfrequently the case, a sort of bewilderment and
                    nervous agitation fell upon her, as she recovered her senses. Perhaps she had
                    been dreaming, and the imaginary events of her dream had blended themselves with
                    the real occurrence which awakened her. But for a minute or two, though she saw
                    the note, and the person who laid it on the table, she could neither bring it to
                    her mind who that person was, nor divest herself of the impression that there
                    was something both dangerous and supernatural in what had passed. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In a little while this feeling passed away, and, though still nervous and
                    trembling, the young girl smiled at her own alarm, as she took up the billet,
                    which was directed to herself in a delicate feminine hand, with the usual form
                    of superscription— </p>
                <div class="tei tei-lg" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em; margin-top: 1.00em">
                    <div class="tei tei-l" style="text-align: left">"To Julia Serena, health"—</div>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> although the writer's name was omitted. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> She gazed at it for a moment, wondering from whom it could come; since she had
                    no habitual correspondent, and the hand-writing, though beautiful, was strange
                    to her. She opened it, and read, her wonder and agitation increasing with every
                    line— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "You love Paullus Arvina," thus it ran, "and are loved by him. He is worthy all
                    your affection. Are you worthy of him, I know not. I love him also, but alas!
                    less happy, am not loved again, nor hope to be, nor indeed deserve it! They tell
                    me you are beautiful; I have seen you, and yet I know not—they told me once
                    that I too was beautiful, and yet I know not! I know this only, that I <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>am desperate, and base, and miserable! Yet fear me
                    not, nor mistake me. I love Paullus, yet would not have him mine, now; no! not
                    to be happy—as to be his would render me. Yet had it not been for you, I might
                    have been virtuous, honourable, happy, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">his</span></span>—for winning
                    him from me, you won from me hope; and with hope virtue; and with virtue honour!
                    Ought I not then to hate you, Julia? Perchance I ought—to do so were at least
                    Roman—and hating to avenge! Perchance, if I <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">hoped</span></span>, I
                    should. But hoping nothing, I hate nothing, dread nothing, and wish
                    nothing.—Yea! by the Gods! I wish to know Paullus happy—yea! more, I wish,
                    even at cost of my own misery, to make him happy. Shall I do so, by making him
                    yours, Julia? I think so, for be sure—be sure, he loves you. Else had he
                    yielded to my blandishments, to my passion, to my beauty! for I am—by the Gods!
                    I am, though he sees it not, as beautiful as thou. And I am proud likewise—or
                    was proud once—for misery has conquered pride in me; or what is weaker yet, and
                    baser—love!" </p>

                    sacrifice myself to win bliss for him—think, girl, how gladly, how
                    triumphantly, I would destroy a rival, who should fail to do that, for which
                    alone I spare her. </p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The astonishment of Paullus, at this strange burst of feeling on the part of one
                    usually so calm, so self-controlled, and seemingly so unimpassioned as that
                    sweet lady, may be more easily imagined than described. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> That she, whose maidenly reserve had never heretofore permitted the slightest,
                    the most innocent freedom of her accepted lover, should cast herself thus into
                    his arms, should rest her head on his bosom, was in itself enough to surprise
                    him; but when to this were added the violent convulsive sobs, which shook her
                    whole frame, the flood of tears, which streamed from her eyes, the wild and
                    disjointed words, which fell from her pale lips, he was struck dumb with
                    something not far removed from terror. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> That it was fear, which shook her thus, he could not credit; for during all the
                    fearful sounds and rumours of the past night, she had been as firm as a hero. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Yet he knew not, dared not think, to what other cause he might attribute it. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He spoke to her soothingly, tenderly, but his voice faltered as he spoke. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Nay! nay! be not alarmed, dear girl!" he said. "The tumults are all, long
                    since, quelled; the danger has <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a name="Pg224" id="Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>all vanished with the
                    darkness, and the storm. Cheer up, my own, sweet, Julia." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And, as he spoke, he passed his arm about her graceful form, and drew her closer
                    to his bosom. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But whether it was this movement, or something in his words that aroused her,
                    she started from his arms in a moment; and stood erect and rigid, pale still and
                    agitated, but no longer trembling. She raised her hands to her brow, and put
                    away the profusion of rich auburn ringlets, which had fallen down dishevelled
                    over her eyes, and gazed at him stedfastly, strangely, as she had never gazed at
                    him before. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Your own Julia!" she said, in slow accents, scarce louder than a whisper, but
                    full of strong and painful meaning. "Oh! I adjure you, by the Gods! by all you
                    love! or hope! Are you false to me, Paullus!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "False! Julia!" he exclaimed, starting, and the blood rushing consciously to his
                    bold face. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I am answered!" she said, collecting herself, with a desperate effort. "It is
                    well—the Gods guard you!—Leave me!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Leave you!" he cried. "By earth, and sea, and heaven, and all that they
                    contain! I know not what you mean." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Know you this writing, then?" she asked him, reaching the letter from the
                    table, and holding it before his eyes. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No more than I know, what so strangely moves you," he answered; and she saw, by
                    the unaffected astonishment which pervaded all his features, that he spoke
                    truly. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Read it," she said, somewhat more composed; "and tell me, who is the writer of
                    it. You must know." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Before he had read six lines, it was clear to him that it must come from Lucia,
                    and no words can describe the agony, the eager intense torture of anticipation,
                    with which he perused it, devouring every word, and at every word expecting to
                    find the damning record of his falsehood inscribed in characters, that should
                    admit of no denial. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Before, however, he had reached the middle of the letter, he felt that he could
                    bear the scrutiny of that pale girl no longer; and, lowering the strip of vellum
                    on which it was written, met her eye firmly. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> For he was resolute for once to do the true and honest thing, let what might
                    come of it. The weaker points of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>his character were
                    vanishing rapidly, and the last few eventful days had done the work of years
                    upon his mind; and all that work was salutary. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> She, too, read something in the expression of his eye, which led her to
                    hope—what, she knew not; and she smiled faintly, as she said— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "You know the writer, Paullus?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Julia, I know her," he replied steadily. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Her!" she said, laying an emphasis on the word, but how affected by it Arvina
                    could not judge. "It <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></span> then a woman?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "A very young, a very beautiful, a very wretched, girl!" he answered. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And you love her?" she said, with an effort at firmness, which itself proved
                    the violence of her emotion. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "By your life! Julia, I do not!" he replied, with an energy, that spoke well for
                    the truth of his asseveration. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Nor ever loved her?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Nor ever—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">loved</span></span> her, Julia." But he hesitated a little
                    as he said it; and laid a peculiar stress on the word loved, which did not
                    escape the anxious ears of the lovely being, whose whole soul hung suspended on
                    his speech. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Why not?" she asked, after a moment's pause, "if she be so very young, and so
                    very beautiful?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I might answer, because I never saw her, 'till I loved one more beautiful.
                    But—" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "But you will not!" she interrupted him vehemently. "Oh! if you love me? if you
                        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">do</span></span> love me, Paullus, do not answer me so." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And wherefore not?" he asked her, half smiling, though little mirthful in his
                    heart, at her impetuosity. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Because if you descend to flatter," answered the fair girl quietly, "I shall be
                    sure that you intended to deceive me." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "It would be strictly true, notwithstanding. For though, as she says, we met
                    years ago, she was but a child then; and, since that time, I never saw her until
                    four or five days ago—" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And since then, how often?" Julia again interrupted him; for, in the intensity
                    of her anxiety, she could not wait the full answer to one question, before
                    another suggested itself to her mind, and found voice at the instant. </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Once, Julia." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Only once?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Once only, by the Gods!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "You have not told me wherefore it was, that you never loved her!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Have I not told you, that I never saw her till a few days, a few hours, I might
                    have said, ago? and does not that tell you wherefore, Julia?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "But there is something more. There is another reason. Oh! tell me, I adjure
                    you, by all that you hold dearest, tell me!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "There is another reason. I told you that she was very young, and very
                    beautiful; but, Julia, she was also very guilty!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Guilty!" exclaimed the fair girl, blushing fiery red, "guilty of loving you!
                    Oh! Paullus! Paullus!" and between shame, and anger, and the repulsive shock
                    that every pure and feminine mind experiences in hearing of a sister's frailty,
                    she buried her face in her hands, and wept aloud. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Guilty, before I ever heard her name, or knew that she existed," answered the
                    young man, fervently; but his heart smote him somewhat, as he spoke; though what
                    he said was but the simple truth, and it was well for him perhaps at the present
                    moment, that Julia did not see his face. For there was much perturbation in it,
                    and it is like that she would have judged even more hardly of that perturbation
                    than it entirely deserved. He paused for a moment, and then added, </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "But if the guilt of woman can be excusable at all, she can plead more in
                    extenuation of her errors, than any of her sex that ever fell from virtue. She
                    is most penitent; and might have been, but for fate and the atrocious wickedness
                    of others, a most noble being—as she is now a most glorious ruin." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> There was another pause, during which neither spoke or moved, Julia overpowered
                    by the excess of her feelings—he by the painful consciousness of wrong; the
                    difficulty of explaining, of extenuating his own conduct; and above all, the
                    dread of losing the enchanting creature, whom he had never loved so deeply or so
                    truly as he did now, when he had well nigh forfeited all claim to her affection. </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg 227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> At length, she raised her eyes timidly to his, and said, </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "This is all very strange—there must be much, that I have a right to hear." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "There is much, Julia!—much that will be very painful for me to tell; and yet
                    more so for you to listen to." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And will you tell it to me?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Julia, I will!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And all? and truly?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And all, and truly, if I tell you at all; but you—" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "First," she said, interrupting him, "read that strange letter to the end. Then
                    we will speak more of these things. Nay?" she continued, seeing that he was
                    about to speak, "I will have it so. It must be so, or all is at an end between
                    us two, now, and for ever. I do not wish to watch you; there is no meanness in
                    my mind, Paullus, no jealousy! I am too proud to be jealous. Either you are
                    worthy of my affection, or unworthy; if the latter, I cast you from me without
                    one pang, one sorrow;—if the first, farther words are needless. Read that wild
                    letter to the end. I will turn my back to you." And seating herself at the
                    table, she took up a piece of embroidery, and made as if she would have fixed
                    her mind upon it. But Paullus saw, as his glance followed her, that,
                    notwithstanding the firmness of her words and manner, her hand trembled so much
                    that she could by no means thread her needle. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He gazed on her for a moment with passionate, despairing love, and as he gazed,
                    his spirit faltered, and he doubted. The evil genius whispered to his soul, that
                    truth must alienate her love, must sever her from him for ever. There was a
                    sharp and bitter struggle in his heart for that moment—but it passed; and the
                    better spirit was again strong and clear within him. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No!" he said to himself, "No! I have done with fraud, and falsehood! I will not
                    win her by a lie! If by the truth I must lose her, be it so! I will be true, and
                    at least I can—die!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Thereon, without another word, he read the letter to the end, neither faltering,
                    nor pausing; and then walked calmly to the table, and laid it down, perfectly
                    resolute and tranquil, for his mind was made up for the worst. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Have you read it?" she asked, and her voice trembled, as much as her hand had
                    done before. </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I have, Julia, to the end. It is very sad—and much of it is true." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And who is the girl, who wrote it?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Her name is Lucia Orestilla." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Orestilla! Ye Gods! ye Gods! the shameless wife of the arch villain Catiline!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Not so—but the wretched, ruined daughter of that abandoned woman!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Call her not woman! By the Gods that protect purity! call her not woman! Did
                    she not prompt the wretch to poison his own son! Oh! call her anything but
                    woman! But what—what—in the name of all that is good or holy, can have brought
                    you to know that awful being's daughter?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "First, Julia, you must promise me never, to mortal ears, to reveal what I now
                    disclose to you." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Have you forgotten, Paullus, that I am yet but a young maiden, and that I have
                    a mother?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Hortensia!" exclaimed the youth, starting back, aghast; for he felt that from
                    her clear eye and powerful judgment nothing could be concealed, and that her
                    iron will would yield in nothing to a woman's tenderness, a woman's mercy. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Hortensia," replied the girl gently, "the best, the wisest, and the tenderest
                    of mothers." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "True? she is all that you say—more than all! But she is resolute, withal, as
                    iron; and stern, and cold, and unforgiving in her anger!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And do you need so much forgiveness, Paullus?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "More, I fear, than my Julia's love will grant me." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I think, my Paullus, you do not know the measure of a girl's honest love. But
                    may I tell Hortensia? If not, you have said enough. What is not fitting for a
                    girl to speak to her own mother, it is not fitting that she should hear at
                    all—least of all from a man, and that man—her lover!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "It is not that, my Julia. But what I have to say contains many lives—mine
                    among others! contains Rome's safety, nay! existence! One whisper breathed
                    abroad, or lisped in a slave's hearing, were the World's ruin. But be it as you
                    will—as you think best yourself and wisest. If you will, tell Hortensia." </p>

                    words, I never had a secret from her!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Be it so, sweet one. Now I implore you, hear me to the end, before you judge
                    me, and then judge mercifully, as the Gods are merciful, and mortals prone to

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And will you tell me the whole truth?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "The whole." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Say on, then. I will hear you to the end; and your guilt must be great,
                    Paullus, if you require a more partial arbitress." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was a trying and painful task, that was forced upon him, yet he went through
                    it nobly. At every word the difficulties grew upon him. At every word the
                    temptation, to swerve from the truth, increased. At every word the dread of
                    losing her, the agony of apprehension, the dull cold sense of despair, waxed
                    heavier, and more stunning. The longer he spoke, the more certain he felt that
                    by his own words he was destroying his own hope; yet he manned his heart
                    stoutly, resisted the foul tempter, and, firm in the integrity of his present
                    purpose, laid bare the secrets of his soul. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Beginning from his discovery of Medon's corpse upon the Esquiline, he now
                    narrated to her fully all that had passed, including much that in his previous
                    tale he had omitted. He told of his first meeting with Cataline upon the Cælian;
                    of his visit to Cicero; of his strange conversation with the cutler Volero; of
                    his second encounter with the traitor in the field of Mars, not omitting the
                    careless accident by which he revealed to him Volero's recognition of the
                    weapon. He told her of the banquet, of the art with which Catiline plied him
                    with wine, of the fascinations of that fair fatal girl. And here, he paused
                    awhile, reluctant to proceed. He would have given worlds, had he possessed them,
                    to catch one glance of her averted eye, to read her features but one moment. But
                    she sat, with her back toward him, her head downcast, tranquil and motionless,
                    save that a tremulous shivering at times ran through her frame perceptible. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He was compelled perforce to continue his narration; and now he was bound to
                    confess that, for the moment, he had been so bewitched by the charms of the
                    siren, that he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>had bound himself by the fatal oath,
                    scarce knowing what he swore, which linked him to the fortunes of the villain
                    father. Slightly he touched on that atrocity of Catiline, by telling which aloud
                    he dared not sully her pure ears. He then related clearly and succinctly the
                    murder of the cutler Volero, his recognition of the murderer, the forced
                    deception which he had used reluctantly toward Cicero, and the suspicions and
                    distrust of that great man. And here again he paused, hoping that she would
                    speak, and interrupt him, if it were even to condemn, for so at least he should
                    be relieved from the sickening apprehension, which almost choked his voice. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Still, she was silent, and, in so far as he could judge, more tranquil than
                    before. For the quick tremors had now ceased to shake her, and her tears, he
                    believed, had ceased to flow. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But was not this the cold tranquillity of a fixed resolution, the firmness of a
                    desperate, self-controlling effort? </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He could endure the doubt no longer. And, in a softer and more humble voice, </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Now, then," he said, "you know the measure of my sin—the extent of my
                    falsehood. All the ill of my tale is told, faithfully, frankly. What remains, is
                    unmixed with evil. Say, then; have I sinned, Julia, beyond the hope of
                    forgiveness? If to confess that, my eyes dazzled with beauty, my blood inflamed
                    with wine, my better self drowned in a tide of luxury unlike aught I had ever
                    known before, my senses wrought upon by every art, and every fascination—if to
                    confess, that my head was bewildered, my reason lost its way for a
                    moment—though my heart never, never failed in its faith—and by the hopes,
                    frail hopes, which I yet cling to of obtaining you—the dread of losing you for
                    ever! Julia, by these I swear, my heart never did fail or falter! If, I say, to
                    confess this be sufficient, and I stand thus condemned and lost for ever, spare
                    me the rest—I may as well be silent!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> She paused a moment, ere she answered; and it was only with an effort, choking
                    down a convulsive sob, that she found words at all. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Proceed," she said, "with your tale. I cannot answer you." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But, catching at her words, with all the elasticity of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>youthful hope, he fancied that she <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">had</span></span> answered him,
                    and cried joyously and eagerly— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Sweet Julia, then you can, you will forgive me." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "I have not said so, Paullus," she began. But he interrupted her, ere she could
                    frame her sentence— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "No! dearest; but your speech implied it, and—" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But here, in her turn, she interrupted him, saying— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Then, Paullus, did my speech imply what I did not intend. For I have <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></span> forgiven—do not know if I can forgive, all that has
                    passed. All depends on that which is to come. You made me promise not to
                    interrupt your tale. I have not done so; and, in justice, I have the right to
                    ask that you should tell it out, before you claim my final answer. So I say,
                    once again, Proceed." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Unable, from the steadiness of her demeanour, so much even as to conjecture what
                    were her present feelings, yet much dispirited at finding his mistake, the young
                    man proceeded with his narrative. Gaining courage, however, as he continued
                    speaking, the principal difficulties of his story being past, he warmed and
                    spoke more feelingly, more eloquently, with every word he uttered. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He told her of the deep depression, which had fallen on him the following
                    morning, when her letter had called him to the house of Hortensia. He again
                    related the attack made on him by Catiline, on the same evening, in Egeria's
                    grotto; and spoke of the absolute despair, in which he was plunged, seeing the
                    better course, yet unable to pursue it; aiming at virtue, yet forced by his
                    fatal oath to follow vice; marking clearly before him the beacon light of
                    happiness and honour, yet driven irresistibly into the gulf of misery, crime,
                    and destruction. He told her of Lucia's visit to his house; how she released him
                    from his fatal oath! disclaimed all right to his affection, nay! to his respect,
                    even, and esteem! encouraged him to hold honour in his eye, and in the scorn of
                    consequence to follow virtue for its own sake! He told her, too, of the
                    conspiracy, in all its terrible details of atrocity and guilt—that dark and
                    hideous scheme of treason, cruelty, lust, horror, from which he had himself
                    escaped so narrowly. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Then, with a glow of conscious rectitude, he proved to her that he had indeed
                    repented; that he was now, how<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>soever he might have
                    been deceived into error and to the brink of crime, firm, and resolved; a
                    champion of the right; a defender of his country; trusted and chosen by the
                    Great Consul; and, in proof of that trust, commissioned by him now to lead his
                    troop of horsemen to Præneste, a strong fortress, near at hand, which there was
                    reason to expect might be assailed by the conspirators. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And now, my tale is ended," he said. "I did hope there would have been no need
                    to reveal these things to you; but from the first, I have been resolved, if need
                    were, to open to you my whole heart—to show you its dark spots, as its bright
                    ones. I have sinned, Julia, deeply, against you! Your purity, your love, should
                    have guarded me! Yet, in a moment of treacherous self-confidence, my head grew
                    dizzy, and I fell. But oh! believe me, Julia, my heart never once betrayed you!
                    Now say—can you pardon me—trust me—love me—be mine, as you promised? If
                    not—speed me on my way, and my first battle-field shall prove my truth to Rome
                    and Julia." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Oh! this is very sad, my Paullus," she replied; "very humiliating—very, very
                    bitter. I had a trust so perfect in your love. I could as soon have believed the
                    sunflower would forget to turn to the day-god, as that Paul would forget Julia.
                    I had a confidence so high, so noble, in your proud, untouched virtue. And yet I
                    find, that at the first alluring glance of a frail beauty, you fall off from
                    your truth to me—at the first whispering temptation of a demon, you half fall
                    off from patriotism—honour—virtue! Forgive you, Paullus! I can forgive you
                    readily. For well, alas! I know that the best of us all are very frail, and
                    prone to evil. Love you? alas! for me, I do as much as ever—but say, yourself,
                    how can I trust you? how can I be yours? when the next moment you may fall again
                    into temptation, again yield to it. And then, what would then remain to the
                    wretched Julia, but a most miserable life, and an untimely grave?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The proud man bowed his head in bitter anguish; he buried his face in his hands;
                    he gasped, and almost groaned aloud, in his great agony. His heart confessed the
                    truth of all her words, and it was long ere he could answer her. Perhaps he
                    would not have collected courage to do so at all, but would have risen in his
                    agony of pride <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and despair, and gone his way to die,
                    heart-broken, hopeless, a lost man. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But she—for her heart yearned to her lover—arose and crossed the room with
                    noiseless step to the spot where he sat, and laid her fair hand gently on his
                    shoulder, and whispered in her voice of silvery music, </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Tell me, Paullus, how can I trust you?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Because I have told you all this, truly! Think you I had humbled myself thus,
                    had I not been firm to resist? think you I have had no temptation to deceive
                    you, to keep back a part, to palliate? and lo! I have told you all—the
                    shameful, naked truth! How can I ever be so bribed again to falsehood, as I have
                    been in this last hour, by hope of winning, and by dread of losing you, my
                    soul's idol? Because I have been true, now to the last, I think that you may
                    trust me." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Are you sure, Paullus?" she said, with a soft sad smile, yet suffering him to
                    retain the little hand he had imprisoned while he was speaking—"very, very
                    sure?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Will you believe me, Julia?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Will you be true hereafter, Paullus?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "By all—" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Nay! swear not by the Gods," she interrupted him; "they say the Gods laugh at
                    the perjury of lovers! But oh! remember, Paullus, that if you were indeed untrue
                    to Julia, she could but die!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He caught her to his heart, and she for once resisted not; and, for the first
                    time permitted, his lips were pressed to hers in a long, chaste, holy kiss. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "And now," he said, "my own, own Julia, I must say fare you well. My horse
                    awaits me at your door—my troopers are half the way hence to Præneste." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Nay!" she replied, blushing deeply, "but you will surely see Hortensia, ere you
                    go." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "It must be, then, but for a moment," he answered. "For duty calls me; and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></span> must not tempt me to break my new-born resolution.
                    But say, Julia, will you tell all these things to Hortensia?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> She smiled, and laid her hand upon his mouth; but he kissed it, and drew it down
                    by gentle force, and repeated his question, </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Will you?" </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Not a word of it, Paul. Do you think me so foolish?" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Then I will—one day, but not now. Meanwhile, let us go seek for her." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And, passing his arm around her slender waist, he led her gently from the scene

                    elections. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> No tumult had occurred, nor any overt act to justify the apprehensions of the
                    people; yet had those apprehensions in no wise abated. The very indistinctness
                    of the rumored terror perhaps increased its weight; and so wide-spread was the
                    vague alarm, so prevalent the dread and excitement, that in the <span class="tei tei-corr">haggard</span> eyes and pale faces of the frustrated
                    conspirators, there was little, if anything, to call attention; for whose
                    features wore their natural expression, during those fearful days, each moment
                    of which might bring forth massacre and conflagration? Whose, but the great
                    Consul's? </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The second morning had arrived; and the broad orb of the newly risen sun, lurid
                    and larger than his wont, as it struggled through the misty haze of the Italian
                    autumn, had scarcely gained sufficient altitude to throw its beams over the
                    woody crest of the Esquiline into the hollow of the Sacred Way. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The slant light fell, however, full on the splendid terraces and shrines of the
                    many-templed Palatine, playing upon their stately porticoes, and tipping their
                    rich capitals with golden lustre. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And at that early hour, the ancient hill was thronged with busy multitudes. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The crisis was at hand—the Senate was in solemn session. The knights were
                    gathered in their force, all arm<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>ed. The younger
                    members of the patrician houses were mustered with their clients. The fasces of
                    the lictors displayed the broad heads of the axes glittering above the rods,
                    which bound them—the axes, never borne in time of peace, or within the city
                    walls, save upon strange emergency. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> In the old temple of Jupiter Stator, chosen on this occasion for the strength of
                    its position, standing on the very brink of the steep declivity of the hill
                    where it overlooked the great Roman forum, that grand assembly sate in grave
                    deliberation. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The scene was worthy of the actors, as were the actors of the strange tragedy in
                    process. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was the cella, or great circular space of the inner temple. The brazen doors
                    of this huge hall, facing the west, as was usual in all Roman temples, were
                    thrown open; and without these, on the portico, yet so placed that they could
                    hear every word that passed within the building, sat on their benches, five on
                    each side of the door, the ten tribunes<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href="#note_19"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a> of the people. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Within the great space, surrounded by a double peristyle of tall Tuscan columns,
                    and roofed by a vast dome, richly carved and gilded, but with a circular opening
                    at the summit, through which a flood of light streamed down on the assembled
                    magnates, the Senate was in session. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Immediately facing the doors stood the old Statue of the God, as old, it was
                    believed by some, as the days of Romulus, with the high altar at its base, hung
                    round with votive wreaths, and glittering with ornaments of gold. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Around this altar were grouped the augurs, each clad, as was usual on occasions
                    of high solemnity, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">trabea</span></span>, or robe of horizontal
                    stripes, in white and purple; each holding in his hand his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">lituus</span></span>, a crooked staff whereby to designate the temples of the
                    heaven, in which to observe the omens. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
                    <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>On every side of the circumference, except that
                    occupied by the altar and the idol, were ranged in circular state the benches of
                    the order. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Immediately to the right of the altar, were placed the curule chairs, rich with
                    carved ivory and crimson cushions, of the two consuls; and behind them, erect,
                    with their shouldered axes, stood the stout lictors. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Cicero, as the first chosen of the consuls, sat next the statue of the God; calm
                    in his outward mien, as the severe and placid features of the marble deity,
                    although within him the soul labored mightily, big with the fate of Rome. Next
                    him Antonius, a stout, bold, sensual-looking soldier, filled his
                    place—worthily, indeed, so far as stature, mien, and bearing were concerned;
                    but with a singular expression in his eye, which seemed to indicate
                    embarrassment, perhaps apprehension. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> After these, the presiding officers of the Republic, were present, each
                    according to his rank, the conscript fathers—first, the Prince of the Senate,
                    and then the Consulars, Censorians, and Prætorians, down to those who had filled
                    the lowest office of the state, that of Quæstor, which gave its occupant, after
                    his term of occupancy expired, admission to the grand representative assembly of
                    the commonwealth. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> For much as there has been written on all sides of this subject, there now
                    remains no doubt that, from the earliest to the latest age of Rome, the Senate
                    was strictly, although an aristocratical, still an elective representative
                    assembly. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The Censors, themselves, elected by the Patricians out of their own order, in
                    the assembly of the Curiæ, had the appointment of the Senators; but from those
                    only who had filled one of the magistracies, all of which were conferred by the
                    popular vote of the assembly of the centuries; and all of which, at this period
                    of the Republic, might be, and sometimes were, conferred on Plebeians—as in the
                    case of Marius, six times elected Consul in spite of Patrician opposition. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Such was the constitution of the Senate, purely elective, though like all other
                    portions of the Roman constitution, under such checks and balances as were
                    deemed sufficient to ensure it from becoming a democratical assembly. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And such, in fact, it never did become. For having <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg 238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                    been at first an elective body chosen from an hereditary aristocracy, it was at
                    that time, save in the varying principles of individuals, wholly aristocratic in
                    its nature. Nor, after the tenure of the various magistracies, which conferred
                    eligibility to the Senate, was thrown open to the plebeians, did any great
                    change follow; since the preponderance of patrician influence in the assembly of
                    the centuries, and the force perhaps of old habit, combined to continue most of
                    the high offices of state in the hands of members of the Old Houses. Again, when
                    plebeians were raised to office, and became, as they were styled, New Men, they
                    speedily were merged in the nobility; and were no less aristocratic in their
                    measures, than the oldest members of the aristocracy. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> For when have plebeians, anywhere, when elevated to superior rank, been true to
                    their origin; been other than the fellest persecutors of plebeians? </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The senate was therefore still, as it had been, a calm and conservative
                    assembly. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> It was not indeed, what it had been, before Marius first, and then Sylla, the
                    avenger, had decimated it of their foes with the sword; and filled the vacancies
                    with unworthy friends and partizans. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Yet it was still a grand, a wise, a noble body—when viewed as a body—and, for
                    the most part, its decisions were worthy of its dignity and power—were sage,
                    conservative, and patriotic. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> On this occasion, all motives had conspired to produce a full house; doubt,
                    anger, fear, excitement, curiosity, the love of country, the strong sense of
                    right, the fiery impulses of interest, hate, vengeance, had urged all men of all
                    parties, to be participants in the eventful business of the day. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> About five hundred senators were present; men of all ages from thirty-two
                        years<a id="noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href="#note_20"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a> upward—that being the earliest at which a man could fill this
                    eminent seat. But the majority were of those, who having passed the prime of
                    active life, might be considered to have reached the highest of mental power and
                    capacity, removed alike from the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>greenness of
                    inconsiderate youth, and the imbecility of extreme old age. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The rare beauty of the Italian race—the strength and symmetry of the unrivalled
                    warrior nation, of which these were, for the most part, the noblest and most
                    striking specimens; the grand flow of the snow-white draperies, faced with the
                    broad crimson laticlave—the classic grace of their positions—the absence of
                    all rigid angular lines, of anything mean or meagre, fantastic or tawdry in the
                    garb of the solemn concourse, rendered the meeting of Rome's Fathers a widely
                    different spectacle from the convention of any other representative assembly,
                    the world has ever witnessed. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> There was no flippancy, no affectation, no light converse—The members, young or
                    old, had come thither to perform a great duty, in strength of purpose,
                    singleness of spirit—and all felt deeply the weight of the present moment, the
                    vastness of the interests concerned. The good and the true were there convened
                    to defend the majesty, perhaps the safety, of their country—the wicked to
                    strive for interest, for revenge, for life itself! </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> For Catiline well knew, and had instilled his knowledge carefully into the minds
                    of his confederates, that now to conquer was indeed to triumph; that now to be
                    defeated was to fail, probably, forever—to die, it was most like, by the dread
                    doom of the Tarpeian. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Not one of the conspirators but was in his appointed place, firm, seemingly
                    unconscious, and unruffled; and as the eye of the great consul glanced from one
                    to another of that guilty throng, he could not, even amid his detestation of
                    their crimes, but admire the cool hardihood with which they sat unmoved on the
                    brink of destruction; could not but think, within himself, how vast the good
                    that might be wrought by such resolution, under a virtuous leader, and in an
                    upright cause. Catiline noticed the glance; and as he marked it run along the
                    crowded benches, dwelling a moment on the face of each one of his own
                    confederates, he saw in an instant, that all was discovered; and, as he saw,
                    resolved that since craft had failed to conceal, henceforth he would trust
                    audacity alone to carry out his detected villainy. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But now the augurs had performed their rites; the day <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was pronounced fortunate; the assembly formal; and nothing more remained, but
                    to proceed to the business of the moment. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A little pause ensued, after the sanction of the augurs had been given; a short
                    space, during which each man drew a deep breath, as though he were aware that
                    ere long he should hear words spoken, that would thrill his every nerve with
                    excitement, and hold him breathless with awe and apprehension. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> There was not a voice, not a motion, not the rustling of a garment, through the
                    large building; for every living form was mute, as the marble effigies around
                    them, with intense expectation. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Every eye of conspirator, or patriot, was riveted upon the consul, the new man
                    of Arpinum. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He rose, not unobservant of the general expectation, nor ungratified; for that
                    great man, with all his grand genius, solid intellect, sound virtue, had one
                    small miserable weakness; he was not proud, but vain; vain beyond the feeblest
                    and most craving vanity of womanhood. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Yet now he showed it not—perhaps felt it, in a less degree than usual; it might
                    be, it was crushed within him for the time, by the magnitude of vast interests,
                    the consciousness of right motives, the necessity of extraordinary efforts. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He rose; advanced a step or two, in front of his curule chair, and in a clear
                    slow voice gave utterance to the solemn words, which formed the exordium to all
                    senatorial business. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "May this be good, and of good omen, happy, and fortunate to the Roman people,
                    the Quirites; which now I lay before you, Fathers, and Conscript Senators." </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> He paused, emphatically, with the formula; and then raising his voice a little,
                    and turning his eyes slowly round the house, as if in mute appeal to all the
                    senators. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "For that," he said, "on which you must this day determine, concerns not the
                    majesty or magnitude of Rome—the question is not now of insolent foes to be
                    chastised, or of faithful friends to be rewarded—is not, how the city shall be
                    made more beautiful, the state more proud and noble, the empire more enduring.
                    No, conscript fathers; for the round world has never seen a city, so flourishing

                    features, which struggled vainly to appear calm and unconcerned. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The effect of the speech was immediate, universal. There were not three men of
                    the order present who were not now convinced as fully in their own minds of the
                    truth of Cicero's accusation, as they would, had it come forth in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg 247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>thunder from the cold lips of the marble God, who
                    overlooked their proud assembly. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> There was a long drawn breath, as he ceased speaking—one, and simultaneous
                    through the whole concourse; and, though there were a few men there, Crassus,
                    especially, and Caius Julius Cæsar, who, though convinced of the existence of
                    conspiracy, would fain have defended the conspirators, in the existing state of
                    feeling, they dared not attempt to do so. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Then Cicero called by name on the Prince of the Senate, enquiring if he would
                    speak on the subject before the house, and on receiving from him a grave
                    negative gesture, he put the same question to the eldest of the consulars, and
                    thence in order, none offering any opinion or showing any wish to debate, until
                    he came to Marcus Cato. He rose at once to speak, stern and composed, without
                    the least sign of animation on his impassive face, without the least attempt at
                    eloquence in his words, or grace in his gestures; yet it was evident that he was
                    heard with a degree of attention, which proved that the character of the man
                    more than compensated the unvarnished style and rough phraseology of the
                    speaker. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "As it appears to me," he said, "Fathers and Conscript Senators, after the very
                    luminous and able oration which our wise consul has this day held forth, it
                    would be great folly, and great loss of time, to add many words to it. This I am
                    not about to do, I assure you, but I arise in my place to say two things. Cicero
                    has told you that a conspiracy exists, and that Catiline is the planner, and
                    will be the executor of it. This, though I know not by what sagacity or
                    foresight, unless from the Gods, he discovered it—this, I say, I believe
                    confidently, clearly—all things declare it—not least the faces of men! I
                    believe therefore, every word our consul has spoken; so do you all, my friends.
                    Nevertheless, it is just and right, that the man, villain as he may be, shall be
                    heard in his own behalf. Let him then speak at once, or confess by his silence!
                    This is the first thing I would say—the next follows it! If he admit, or fail
                    clearly to disprove his guilt, let us not be wanting to ourselves, to our
                    country, or to the great and prudent consul, who, if man can, will save us in
                    this crisis. Let us, I say, decree forthwith, '<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">That the Consuls
                        see</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-variant: small-caps"> the Republic takes no harm</span></span>!' and let us
                    hold the consular election to-morrow, on the field of Mars—There, with our
                    magistrates empowered to act, our clients in arms to defend us, let us see who
                    will dare to disturb the Roman people! Let who would do so, remember that not
                    all the power or favor of Great Marius could rescue Saturninus from the death he
                    owed the people—remember that we have a consul no less resolute and vigorous,
                    than he is wise and good—that there are axes in the fasces of the Lictors—that
                    there stands the Tarpeian!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> And as he spoke, he flung wide both his arms; pointing with this hand to the row
                    of glittering blades which shone above the head of the chief magistrate, with
                    that, through the open door-way of the temple, to the bold front of the
                    precipitous and fatal rock, all lighted up by the gay sunbeams, as it stood
                    fronting them, beyond the hollow Velabrum, crowned with the ramparts of the
                    capitol. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> A general hum, as if of assent, followed, and without putting the motion to the
                    vote, Cicero turned his eye rapidly to every face, and receiving from every
                    senator a slight nod of assent, he looked steadily in the fierce and ghastly
                    face of the traitor, and said to him; </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Arise, Catiline, and speak, if you will!—But take my counsel, confess your
                    guilt, go hence, and be forgiven!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Forgiven!" cried the traitor, furious and desperate—"Forgiven!—this to a Roman
                    citizen!—this to a Roman noble! Hear me, Fathers and Conscript Senators—hear
                    me!—who am a soldier and a man, and neither driveller nor dotard. I tell you,
                    there is no conspiracy, hath been none, shall be none—save in the addled brains
                    of yon prater from Arpinum, who would fain set his foot upon the neck of Romans.
                    All is, all shall be peace in Rome, unless the terror of a few dastards drive
                    you to tyranny and persecution, and from persecution come resistance? For
                    myself, let them who would ruin me, beware. My hand has never yet failed to
                    protect my head, nor have many foes laughed in the end at Sergius
                    Catiline!—unless," he added with a ferocious sneer—"they laughed in their
                    death-pang. For my wrongs past, I have had some vengeance; for these, though I
                    behold the axes, though I see, whence I stand, the steep Tarpeian, I think I
                    shall have more, and live to feast my eyes with the downfall of my foes.
                    Fathers, there <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>are two bodies in the State, one
                    weak, with a base but crafty head—the other powerful and vast, but headless.
                    Urge me a little farther, and you shall find that a wise and daring head will
                    not be wanting long, to that bold and puissant body. Urge me, and I will be that
                    head; oppress me, and—" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But insolence such as this, was not tolerable. There was an universal burst,
                    almost a shout, of indignation from that assembly, the wonted mood of which was
                    so stern, so cold, so gravely dignified, and silent. Many among the younger
                    senators sprang to their feet, enraged almost beyond the control of reason; nor
                    did the bold defiance of the daring traitor, who stood with his arms folded on
                    his breast, and a malignant sneer of contempt on his lip, mocking their impotent
                    displeasure, tend to disarm their wrath. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Four times he raised his voice, four times a cry of indignation drowned his
                    words, and at length, seeing that he could obtain no farther hearing, he resumed
                    his seat with an expression fiendishly malignant, and a fierce imprecation on
                    Rome, and all that it contained. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> After a little time, the confusion created by the audacity of that strange being
                    moderated; order and silence were restored, and, upon Cato's motion, the Senate
                    was divided. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Whatever might have been the result had Catiline been silent, the majority was
                    overwhelming. The very partisans and favorers of the conspiracy, not daring to
                    commit themselves more openly, against so strong a manifestation, passed over
                    one by one, and voted with the consul. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Catiline stood alone, against the vote of the whole order. Yet stood and voted
                    resolute, as though he had been conscious of the right. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The vote was registered, the Senate declared martial law, investing the consuls
                    with dictatorial power, by the decree which commanded them to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">see
                        that the Republic takes no harm</span></span>. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The very tribunes, factious and reckless as they were, potent for ill and
                    powerless for good, presumed not to interpose. Not even Lucius Bestia, deep as
                    he was in the design—Bestia, whose accusation of the consul from the rostrum
                    was the concerted signal for the massacre, the conflagration—not Bestia
                    himself, relied so far on the inviolability of his person, as to intrude his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">veto</span></span>. </p>
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> The good cause had prevailed—the good Consul triumphed! The Senate was
                    dismissed, and as the stream of patrician togas flowed through the temple door
                    conspicuous, the rash and reckless traitor shouldered the mass to and fro,
                    dividing it as a brave galley under sail divides the murmuring but unresisting
                    billows. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> Once in the throng he touched Julius Cæsar's robe as he brushed onward, and as
                    he did so, a word fell on his ear in the low harmonious tones which marked the
                    orator, second to none in Rome, save Cicero alone!— </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Fear not," it said—"another day will come!—" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> "Fear!—" exclaimed the Conspirator in a hoarse cry, half fury, half contempt.
                    "What is fear?—I know not the thing, nor the word!—Go, prate of fear to
                    Cicero, and he will understand you!" </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> These words perhaps alienated one who might have served him well. </p>
                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"> But so it ever is! Even in the shrewdest and most worldly wise of men, passion
                    will often outweigh interest; and plans, which have been framed for years with
                    craft and patience, are often wrecked by the impetuous rashness of a moment.

            any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
            outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and

            originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that
            could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and
            distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer
            support.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of
            which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
            notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in
            compliance with any particular paper edition.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
            eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
            compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Corrected <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">editions</span></em> of our eBooks replace the old file
            and take over the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file
            is renamed. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Versions</span></em> based on separate sources are treated
